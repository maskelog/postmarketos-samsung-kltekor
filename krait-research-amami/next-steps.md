# Next steps

Rewritten 2026-09-12, after a long session that fixed a core-wedging bug of our own
making, produced the first power numbers, and then solved the GPU IOMMU.

The headline change since the last version: **the GPU IOMMU works**, and the thing
that cracked it was not another build. Five rebuild-and-guess cycles had failed;
reading the SMMU's own registers on a running phone through `/dev/mem` found both
bugs in one sitting. Prefer instrumenting the hardware over rebuilding it.

## Start here

**Device state as of 2026-09-19 end of day: r119 is flashed and installed**, so
the boot image and `/lib/modules` agree for the first time in a while and
`uname -v` prints `#120`. Images kept in `boot-images/`: r119
`73600a403efcdf28397441abccbc7099`, r116 `66305348a849b9749e013a805624fe59`
(the last one before the battery-temperature work), r90
`c2f94594ff341f68e5a1ce5aa04a1abd`.

They do not always agree, and that is not a mistake when they differ: the codec
is `CONFIG_SND_SOC_WCD9320=m`, so codec patches ship in `snd-soc-wcd9320.ko` and
an `apk add` is enough. A `dd` to the boot partition is only needed when a `=y`
driver or the device tree changes - which `0068` (capture dai-links), `0070`
(`CONFIG_CHARGER_QCOM_SMBB=y`) and `0071` all did.

**The codec reloads now, so stop rebooting between codec builds.** `0065` and
`0066` fixed the unload and the reload respectively, and the whole cycle is:

    D=/sys/bus/platform/drivers/msm-snd-apq8096
    sudo sh -c "echo sound > $D/unbind"      # frees the module
    sudo modprobe -r snd_soc_wcd9320
    sudo apk add --allow-untrusted /tmp/linux-...apk
    sudo modprobe snd_soc_wcd9320
    sudo sh -c "echo sound > $D/bind"

The unbind is not optional - the card holds a reference and `modprobe -r` fails
with "Module snd_soc_wcd9320 is in use" without it, which silently turns the
following `modprobe` into a no-op and leaves you measuring the *old* instance.
That wasted two full test cycles; assert `lsmod | grep -c` is 0 before
reloading.

**The codec is blacklisted** in `/etc/modprobe.d/wcd9320-test.conf`, so after every
reboot the card does not exist until you run `sudo modprobe snd-soc-wcd9320`. An
empty `/sys/class/sound/` is that, not a regression. The blacklist dates from r89,
when loading the codec oopses while building the card; `0052` fixed that oops and
it now loads cleanly, so the file can go whenever the manual step stops being
useful. Everything else is unaffected. All five sensors - accel, gyro, mag, proximity
and light - work when enabled on their own. Nothing is half-applied, and the
recipe, the flash and `/lib/modules` all agree at r87.

**Note the ADSP can lose a probe race at boot.** `qcom_smgr` has been seen to fail
once with `Failed to get available sensors: -ETIMEDOUT`, or with
`Single sensor info request failed: 0x701` on one sensor ID, and then succeed on
the retry. It is transient and not caused by any patch here - check
`/sys/bus/iio/devices/` before assuming a build broke the sensors.

**Mind the numbering: `pkgrel` + 1 is what `uname -v` prints.** r84 reports `#85`
and r85 reports `#86`, which is an easy way to think you booted the wrong thing.

r84 (`#85`) remains the fallback worth keeping - it is the last build whose every
feature was tested - and its image is still at
`boot-images/boot-r84.img`, md5 `d4550bf58700118ce0b3ee31aee67999`.

    boot partition:  /dev/disk/by-partlabel/boot  ->  mmcblk0p14  (20971520 bytes)

    r56:               69b89a70e0a216cc128579bea40f5561  (18153472 bytes)
    all three images kept in ~/Devices/Xperia-Z1-Compact/boot-images/

**Flashing from the running phone works and is cheaper than a fastboot cycle.** No
cable-holding, no Volume Up. Stage the image to `/tmp` first and check its md5 there,
so a bad transfer cannot reach the partition, then `dd ... conv=fsync` and read back:

    scp boot-images/boot-r84.img mahan@172.16.42.1:/tmp/
    ssh mahan@172.16.42.1 'md5sum /tmp/boot-r84.img'
    ssh mahan@172.16.42.1 'sudo dd if=/tmp/boot-r84.img of=/dev/disk/by-partlabel/boot bs=4M conv=fsync; sync'
    ssh mahan@172.16.42.1 'sudo head -c 18219008 /dev/disk/by-partlabel/boot | md5sum'

Two things about that md5. It is taken **over the image length, not the partition** -
the partition is 20 MB and hashing all of it includes trailing padding, which is why
a whole-device `md5sum` gives `fa97d700...` and not the documented number. And the
bytes past the new image are left over from whatever was there before; harmless,
since the bootloader reads the length from the header.

**`dd` to boot is enough only when nothing new is a module.** `uname -r` is
`6.16.12` for every one of these builds - `pkgrel` only moves `uname -v` - so they
share `/lib/modules/6.16.12`, and r84 ran happily on r56's modules with `wcn36xx`,
`mac80211` and bluetooth loaded and `wlan0` connected.

**r85 broke that, and the reason is worth knowing.** `SLIM_QCOM_NGD_CTRL` cannot be
built in here: it `depends on QCOM_RPROC_COMMON`, which the remoteproc drivers
`select` while themselves being `=m`, and a `select` from a module caps the selected
symbol at `m`. So setting it `=y` in the config is silently downgraded, and the
driver ships as `slim-qcom-ngd-ctrl.ko`. Since `CONFIG_MODVERSIONS=y` and r85 also
moves the QMI and PDR helpers from `m` to `y`, reusing the old `/lib/modules` was not
safe either. The full path, which is what was done:

    scp linux-...-r85.apk mahan@172.16.42.1:/tmp/
    ssh ... 'sudo apk add --allow-untrusted /tmp/linux-...-r85.apk'   # modules + initramfs
    ssh ... 'cat /boot/initramfs' > initramfs                          # AFTER apk add
    tools/mkbootimg.py --kernel vmlinuz --dtb ...amami.dtb --initramfs initramfs -o boot-r85.img
    # then stage, verify and dd as above

`apk add` regenerates the initramfs and runs `boot-deploy`, which writes
`/boot/boot.img` as a **file** and does not touch the partition - checked, the
partition still held r84 afterwards. Its image is unusable anyway, since it carries
`boot-deploy`'s own `quiet splash plymouth` command line instead of the one this port
needs. See [[xperia-z1c-flashing-modules]].

**Blacklist a new driver for its first boot.** `/etc/modprobe.d/` with
`blacklist slim_qcom_ngd_ctrl` meant the first r85 boot exercised only the DT, and
the driver went in afterwards by hand with dmesg watched - a crash then costs a
`modprobe`, not a boot loop. An explicit `modprobe` ignores the blacklist, which is
what makes this work. Removed once it was known safe.

### The next jobs

1. **The WCD9320 codec driver** - now the only thing between this phone and
   sound, and the largest single piece of audio work. APR, the Q6 services, the
   frontend DAIs and SLIMbus are all up, and the Taiko enumerates on the bus;
   mainline simply has no driver for that part. wcd9335 is the closest relative
   to work from. See Phase 3.
2. **Deep suspend**, now measured to be worth it: s2idle saves only 37%, and the gap
   between 156 mA and single-digit standby is the largest remaining battery item. See
   Phase 2.
3. **Proximity**, still the one sensor that enumerates but never reports.

### Two traps worth not rediscovering

- **`/sys/kernel/debug/regmap/0-01/registers` is unusable on pm8941.** Every register
  is a separate SPMI transaction and the file walks the whole address space, so even
  a `head -c` of the first few hundred KB does not return, and the reader is
  effectively unkillable while it runs. Three attempts pushed load average past 5.
  The SMBB notes elsewhere in this file describe reading `0-00` that way - treat that
  as "for a small range, patiently", not as a general technique.
- **Do not `pkill -f <script>` from the host** to clean up something running on the
  phone. The pattern matches the local `ssh` command that contains the script name,
  so it kills the session issuing it. Kill by PID over ssh, on the phone.

## Where the port stands

Working: panel, touch, Xfce on freedreno, WiFi, Bluetooth, charging (on a real
supply), battery percentage, USB networking, sensors bar proximity, the notification
LED, the vibrator, suspend (s2idle), GPU and CPU frequency scaling, CPU thermal
throttling, and SLIMbus - the Taiko enumerates, though nothing can drive it yet.

Not working: audio (the codec driver is all that is left), deep suspend.

**The sensor story is complete as of 2026-09-16**: accelerometer, gyroscope,
magnetometer, proximity and ambient light all work, each enabled on its own. See
Phase 1.

The vibrator **works** as of `0040` - felt, not merely enumerated - and the ADSP
audio transport is up as of `0039` with all four Q6 services attached as of `0041`.
Audio still makes no sound: the codec driver is the blocker, see below.

The GPU IOMMU works as of `0034`-`0036`. The MDP half (`0037`) reclaims the 192MB
carveout but blanks the panel, and all of it is out of the build.

### Where the build recipe actually is

Worth stating because it lives on disk in pmaports, not in this repo, so nothing here
records it and a new session would have to look:

- **Flashed on the phone: r90**, and the pmaports recipe is also r90, so they
  agree. It is `0001`-`0029` as usual plus `0039` (APR), `0040` (vibrator),
  `0041` (q6asm DAIs), `0042`-`0044` (SLIMbus), `0045`, `0047` and `0048`, with `CONFIG_QCOM_APR`, the
  `SND_SOC_QDSP6_*` symbols and `CONFIG_SLIMBUS` on. No IOMMU patches,
  `# CONFIG_ARM_SMMU is not set`.
- **`uname -v` prints `pkgrel` + 1.** r85 reports `#86`. Easy to misread as having
  booted the wrong build.
- Earlier images are kept in `~/Devices/Xperia-Z1-Compact/boot-images/`: r84
  (`d4550bf58700118ce0b3ee31aee67999`) is the last build before SLIMbus, and
  r56-rebuilt (`69b89a70e0a216cc128579bea40f5561`) reproduces what was flashed for
  most of this port's life.
- Apks r57-r86 in `~/.local/var/pmbootstrap/packages/` are a mix of experiments;
  several are IOMMU builds. Numbering is monotonic but the contents are not a
  progression - check the config inside one before trusting it.

## What is instrumented

These did not exist before and they change which experiments are cheap:

- **An ammeter.** `0023` fixed `qcom-spmi-iadc`; battery current is signed microamps
  at ~0.55 mA resolution, cross-checked between two sense resistors to 5-7%.
  Measuring needs the USB cable **out** - on a host port the battery floats.
- **pstore.** `ramoops` with a 1 MB console buffer. Survives a panic or soft reboot,
  not a forced power-off. `systemd-pstore` moves records to
  `/var/lib/systemd/pstore/`.
- **A panic net** in the standard command line:
  `sysctl.kernel.panic_on_rcu_stall=1 panic=10 rcupdate.rcu_exp_cpu_stall_timeout=21000`.
  Keep all three together; the third is in **milliseconds** and its default fires on a
  harmless expedited stall every boot.
- **A test pattern.** Flash a known-good kernel, `fastboot boot` the experiment, change
  one variable, soak past the known failure point. That found the cpufreq bug.
- **`no_hash_pointers`** on the command line when a `%p` needs to be real. That is what
  turned the IOMMU `-EBUSY` from a guess into a fact.

## Phase 1: read before building

The GPU IOMMU is done - and it was solved by instrumenting the running hardware, not
by finding a source, which is worth remembering. Proximity still needs one.

### The GPU IOMMU: solved, and deliberately not in the build

`0034` and `0035` make the GPU render through its SMMU. Three-minute soak: zero
hangchecks, 55,145 GPU interrupts, fences retiring within three of submission, no
fault on any line.

Two bugs, both found by reading the hardware on a running system rather than by
rebuilding:

- **`SCTLR.AFE` does not work.** `io-pgtable-arm-v7s` sets `AP[0]` - the access flag -
  in every descriptor, and the walk still ends in an access flag fault on the
  ringbuffer. `0035` clears the bit, which also yields the permissions the mappings
  asked for rather than merely silencing the fault.
- **Both SMMU interrupt numbers were wrong**, which is why none of it was ever
  visible. Global fault is SPI 38; the context list is indexed by `CBAR.IRPTNDX`
  rather than by bank number, and the hardware raises on SPI 240 + IRPTNDX, so it has
  to start at 240. Getting this wrong is silent - FSR latches, the transaction is
  terminated, and a faulting GPU looks like an idle one. Getting it off by one is
  worse: the fault lands on a line bound to another bank, whose handler sees a clean
  FSR, and the level-triggered line storms until the kernel says `nobody cared`.

**It stays out of the build**, and now for a measured reason. Like-for-like at
320MHz, `vblank_mode=0`: 780 FPS on the carveout kernel against 154 FPS behind the
SMMU, both with zero hangchecks. Five times the cost, and it reclaims nothing until
the **MDP** has an IOMMU, because `msm_use_mmu()` tests the display controller.

**Where the five-fold cost goes is now measured: translation itself.** Zero SMMU
maintenance calls in five seconds of load, glxgears blocked on the GPU rather than the
CPU (94.5% of a core down to 26.7%), and throughput inversely proportional to pixel
count while a 64x64 window reaches the carveout kernel's own CPU-bound ceiling. No
fixed per-frame cost; a cost on every memory access, i.e. TLB misses walking uncached
page tables.

Ruled out: runtime PM (pinned vs auto is identical to three decimal places), and
`dma-coherent` - `IDR0.CTTW` claims coherent walks are supported, but turning it on
kills the GPU outright and storms both fault lines, because the interconnect is not
coherent with the CPU.

**Page size was the lever, and `0036` took the gap from 5.1x to 1.53x.** IOVAs were
allocated with `PAGE_SIZE` alignment, so `iommu_pgsize()` could never coalesce and
every mapping was a 4KB page. `0036` aligns both the IOVA allocator and the VRAM
carveout allocator to the largest page an object can fill; aligning one without the
other does nothing. Verified in the page tables - 7 sections of 1MB and 92 large pages
of 64KB now, against none before.

| window | carveout | IOMMU, 4KB | IOMMU, `0036` |
|---|---|---|---|
| 200x200 | 855 FPS | 340 FPS | 876 FPS |
| 300x300 | 783 FPS | 154 FPS | 511 FPS |
| 400x400 | 834 FPS | 88 FPS | 276 FPS |

The rest of the gap is the 366 remaining small pages and the cost of translating at
all. Whether to turn the IOMMU on is now a real judgement call rather than an obvious
no - it buys GPU memory protection that the carveout cannot.

Also still untested on its own: `msm8974_smmu_write_s2cr` forces `NSCFG`/`MEMATTR` on
a theory that later proved wrong.

The technique is the reusable part. `CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM` is off, so `/dev/mem`
reaches any register block directly - but pin its runtime PM first
(`echo on > /sys/bus/platform/devices/<dev>/power/control`) or the read hangs the
bus on an unclocked block.

Two cautions learned the hard way. A GIC pending scan is only evidence if the line was
*not* already pending beforehand - the first pass at the interrupt numbers accepted
SPI 37 while it had been pending from boot, and it was another device's. And a zero
fault counter proves nothing once the faults are fixed; verify delivery by *injecting*
one. Forcing `SCTLR.AFE` back on for a bank is a reliable fault generator here.

Downstream's device tree is worth having as a cross-check and is one command away:
the LineageOS `boot.img` carries a QCDT container of DTBs, and `mdp_iommu` /
`kgsl_iommu` sit in it with real addresses, SIDs and interrupts. It is not the final
authority - its `kgsl_iommu` lists SPI 241 for all three GPU contexts, which is only
right for whichever one lands on IRPTNDX 1 - but it is what flagged the first
interrupt guess as wrong. Prefer **stock** firmware to LineageOS where it matters:
Lineage descends from Sony's GPL tree but drifts, while stock pairs with the
TrustZone image the phone actually boots. Stock is an FTF of `.sin` containers, so it
needs an extra unpacking step.

For the MDP IOMMU, downstream says: base `fd928000`, contexts at `fd930000`+ (the same
base+0x8000 layout, so the `numpage` quirk carries over), global SPI 73, context
interrupts SPI 47 and 46 - and `qcom,iommu-secure-id = <1>`, which `kgsl_iommu` does
not have. TrustZone owns that one.

### The MDP IOMMU: done, and it is what reclaimed the 192MB

`msm_use_mmu()` tests the display controller, not the GPU, so the carveout survives a
perfectly good GPU IOMMU and only goes away here. `0037` adds `mdp_smmu@fd928000` and
points the MDP at it.

Cheaper than expected on every axis. It is the **same hardware as the GPU's SMMU** -
identical probe, and the `numpage` write-back test reads `0xdeadbee0` at `+0x8000`,
agreeing with stock's `mdp_0` at `0xfd930000` - so `0034`/`0035` carry over with **no
new driver code**. Stock and LineageOS describe both IOMMUs identically. And despite
`qcom,iommu-secure-id = <1>`, **TrustZone does not block the non-secure side**, so the
`qcom_scm_restore_sec_cfg` that `arm-smmu-qcom` lacks is not needed.

Result: carveout gone, display fine, `FD330` still the renderer, zero faults on all
six lines the two SMMUs register, and `CmaFree` from 65152 kB to 261760 kB - exactly
192MiB back. Net usable memory gains less, since the buffers now come from ordinary
memory instead of a reservation.

**Boot with `arm-smmu.disable_bypass=0`.** This SMMU sits in the display path whether
or not anything attaches to it, `arm_smmu_device_reset()` rewrites every S2CR before
`impl->reset` runs, and undescribed MDSS masters still have to get through. With the
bypass disabled it blanks the panel just by probing.

**It costs the page-size win.** Without a carveout, GEM comes from shmem as scattered
order-0 pages, so `iommu_pgsize()` cannot coalesce whatever the IOVA alignment is -
walking both SMMUs afterwards finds no sections and no large pages at all. Throughput
returns to the 4KB figures, 329 FPS at 200x200 against 876. Huge pages would fix it
and are not reachable: `HAVE_ARCH_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE` is selected only `if
ARM_LPAE`, which is off - which is also why the IOMMU uses v7s short descriptors.
Having both would need a CMA-backed GEM allocator rather than shmem.

**`0037` is not finished: the panel is black.** The SMMU attaches, the carveout goes
away and about 172MB comes back, but nothing reaches the screen. It was briefly turned
on by default on the strength of console checks - `fb0` registered, backlight lit,
`FD330`, 151 FPS, zero faults - none of which test scanout. The one line `0037`
removes is `no IOMMU, fallback to phys contig buffers for scanout`.

**Measured: the fault is on the page-table walk.** With the bypass enabled so anything
unmatched faults loudly, `cb1 FSR 0x10` (external fault) with `FSYNR0 0x581` - bit 10
is PTWF, `PLVL` 1. The SMMU aborts fetching its own level-1 descriptor. `sGFSR` stays
0, so nothing is unmatched.

The display is not failing to read its framebuffer; **the SMMU cannot read its own
page tables**. Walking them from the CPU works fine, which is what made the first four
attempts chase the wrong transaction.

Dead ends, all tested on hardware: an unmapped MDSS stream (`sGFSR` is 0);
`qcom_scm_restore_sec_cfg` (collapses the stream ID mask to 0 from `cfg_probe`, and
wedges the phone with mmc timeouts and an RCU stall from `init_context` - Sony's TZ is
on the legacy SCM convention and does not mean what `qcom_iommu.c` expects); and
downstream's 18 BFB registers, applied verbatim and read back correctly, with the
fault unchanged.

**The question to answer next:** why can this SMMU's table-walk master not read normal
memory when the GPU's identical SMMU can? Same IP, tables in the same low physical
range. What differs is the clocks, the power domain and the NoC path - so start there,
and compare against how downstream sets up MDSS bus votes before first use.

**Rule for this one: no claim about the display until someone has looked at the
panel.** `fb0`, `bl_power`, `glxinfo` and a frame counter all pass while the screen is
black.

### Proximity: SOLVED 2026-09-16. It needs a second sensor subscribed

**The sensor works.** With the accelerometer subscribed at the same time and a
hand moving over the phone:

    [ 0.0s] values=(0,     56, 0)     far,  raw IR 56
    [15.0s] values=(65536, 525, 0)    NEAR, raw IR 525
    [22.1s] values=(0,    288, 0)     far
    [23.1s] values=(65536, 521, 0)    NEAR
    [26.5s] values=(0,    306, 0)     far
    [29.9s] values=(65536, 518, 0)    NEAR

`values[0]` toggles 0 <-> 65536 - Q16 for 0.0 and 1.0, far and near - and
`values[1]` is the raw IR count. The hardware, the ADSP path, the IIO driver and
its scaling were never broken.

**The whole bug is that proximity emits nothing unless another SMGR sensor is
subscribed at the same time.** Demonstrated three ways, each with a control in the
same run:

| | proximity samples |
|---|---|
| proximity alone | **none, ever** |
| accelerometer running, proximity added | 1 on enable, then one per change |
| accelerometer subscribed then *deleted*, then proximity | 1 on enable |

and through the kernel exactly the same way - `buffer/data_available` stays 0 for
proximity alone, and reads 1 the moment the accelerometer's buffer is enabled
first. Nothing else matters: sampling rate 1 to 100, `val1`/`val2`, primary versus
secondary data type, and `report_rate` across seven values from 0 to
`rate * 32768 * 2` all change nothing on their own.

**Why nobody hit this on Android:** the accelerometer is effectively always
subscribed there, for screen rotation alone, so proximity always had a co-active
sensor. Stock's own `dumpsys` shows only two proximity events in a session, both
`0.00`, which is what an on-change sensor looks like when nothing approaches it -
so that capture never contradicted this either.

**`0047` implements the fix, and it works - verified end to end.** When a PROX_LIGHT
sensor is enabled, the driver now takes out a second subscription on the same
chip's ambient light channel at 1 Hz under report ID `0xfe`, waits 100 ms, and
only then subscribes proximity. With it, **proximity enabled entirely on its own
reaches `buffer/data_available = 1`**, where it was 0 in every previous
measurement. That part is solid and reproducible.

Three things were measured to get there, each with a control:

- **Any partner works, and 1 Hz is enough.** Accelerometer at 50 Hz and at 1 Hz,
  gyroscope at 1 Hz, magnetometer at 1 Hz and this chip's own light channel at
  1 Hz all produce the on-enable report; no partner produces nothing, twice.
  Light is used because it powers no other part - 175uA, and the chip is already
  on.
- **It must be a separate request.** Putting both data types in one request's
  `items[]` subscribes ambient light and leaves proximity silent, which is why
  `0031` is not this fix.
- **The partner has to settle first.** Sending both requests back to back fails
  even though the first QMI transaction has completed; 50 ms was the shortest gap
  measured to work, 0 ms the longest to fail, hence 100 ms.

**Verified end to end 2026-09-16.** Proximity enabled on its own, with the
keepalive as its only company, tracks a hand exactly as it should:

    proximity alone: 14 samples
       [  0] raw=65536  NEAR
       [  1] raw=0      far
       ...alternating, 7 NEAR and 7 far, no spurious readings

and with the ambient light device enabled alongside as an independent witness,
the same run shows light dropping 11.0 -> 0.0 lux while proximity reports 5 NEAR
and 5 far. The witness matters: it is the only way to know a hand was actually
over the sensor, and two earlier attempts at this test failed on exactly that -
they recorded nothing because nobody was at the phone, which is indistinguishable
from a driver that does not work if you are not watching the light.

So `0047` is sufficient on its own. Nothing else has to be enabled for proximity
to work.

**How to test this, because the obvious way misleads.** Never judge proximity by
whether samples arrive, on its own. Enable `qcom-smgr-light` alongside it and
watch the lux: covering the sensor drops it to 0, which is independent proof a
hand was there. Without that witness, "no samples" and "nobody touched the phone"
look identical - and did, twice.

### Ambient light: works, as its own IIO device

`0048` exposes the APDS-9930's ambient light channel as `qcom-smgr-light`, a
second IIO device on the same sensor. Enabled on its own it gives **121 samples
in 6 s at 15 Hz**, reading 11-14 lux in a dim room, which matches what the same
channel reports at the QMI level.

It has to be a second *device*, not a second channel, because the DSP will not
report both of a sensor's data types from one subscription - the same constraint
that rules out `0031` as a proximity fix. So a sensor's secondary data type gets
its own subscription, and needs a report ID distinct from the primary's: the top
bit marks it, since sensor IDs are all well under `0x80`. The report handler
routes `sensor->id` to the primary IIO device and `sensor->id | 0x80` to the
secondary one.

No scaling work was needed - the driver's generic branch already gives
`1/65536`, and light is reported as lux in Q16.

Ambient light needs no keepalive of its own: unlike proximity it reports happily
on its own, and is itself a perfectly good second subscription.

**One loose end:** light samples carry a timestamp of 0, where proximity's are
populated. Harmless for reading values, wrong for anything that cares about when
they were taken.

**How this stayed hidden for so long, which is the transferable part.** Every
earlier measurement enabled proximity on its own, so every one of them was
measuring a case that cannot work. The first IIO read that ever returned 16 bytes
was dismissed here as stale buffer content - it was real, and it worked because
that test enabled the accelerometer first and proximity second. Tidying that
script into a "clean" one that tested proximity in isolation removed the only
reason it had worked.

## Phase 2: deep suspend

**The biggest remaining lever on this phone**, bigger than the IOMMU, and as of
2026-09-14 that is measured rather than asserted. It is why idle costs ~248 mA and
why suspending saves only 37% of it: cores collapse individually while the SoC never
does, so the RPM stays up, rails stay put and DDR stays refreshed.

It is unimplemented, not unconfigured, and that is now verified three ways rather
than assumed. `arch/arm/mach-qcom` holds only `Kconfig`, `Makefile` and `platsmp.c`;
nothing anywhere registers `platform_suspend_ops`; and the phone itself reports

    /sys/power/state:     freeze mem
    /sys/power/mem_sleep: [s2idle]

with no `deep` offered, so `mem` is just s2idle under another name. `ARM_PSCI` is off,
so there is no firmware route either.

**Per-core idle is already at mainline's maximum**, which is worth knowing before
looking for easy wins there. `cpuidle-qcom-spm.c` offers exactly one state type,
`qcom,idle-state-spc` - standalone power collapse - and no system-wide variant, and
the phone uses it well: 74799 entries and 1740 seconds of residency in a short uptime,
against 25640 in plain WFI. The cores collapse. The SoC does not.

Three separate pieces are missing, each verified in tree:

1. **No platform suspend ops.** Nothing implements `PM_SUSPEND_MEM`, so there is
   nothing for `mem_sleep` to select.
2. **No system-wide SPM programming.** `cpuidle-qcom-spm.c` knows only standalone
   collapse. It does already call `qcom_scm_set_warm_boot_addr(cpu_resume_arm)`, so
   the resume path exists and is proven - that part would not have to be invented.
3. **No RPM sleep-set votes.** `QCOM_SMD_RPM_SLEEP_STATE` is defined in
   `include/linux/soc/qcom/smd-rpm.h`, and `qcom_smd-regulator.c` never uses it -
   zero occurrences. Mainline votes only the active set, so even a collapsed SoC would
   leave the rails where they are. This is the piece that actually saves the power,
   and it is independent of the other two.

That last point suggests the cheapest first experiment by a wide margin: sleep-set
votes are a regulator concern, not a suspend concern, and could be investigated on
their own without implementing suspend at all.

**The DSPs are not where the power goes - measured 2026-09-19.** Before
committing to the suspend work it was worth asking what the idle draw actually
consists of, since both the ADSP and WCNSS are held up continuously and the ADSP
is only up because the sensor and audio work put it there. USB unplugged, screen
off, `in_current1_raw` sampled every 10s, 24 samples per phase:

| phase | current | delta |
|---|---|---|
| settle | -253.6 mA | |
| A, both DSPs running | **-245.9 mA** | baseline |
| B, ADSP stopped | **-245.2 mA** | **-0.7 mA** |
| C, ADSP + WCNSS stopped | **-213.9 mA** | **-31.3 mA** |

Sample-to-sample spread is about +-30 mA, so with n=24 the ADSP's 0.7 mA is
indistinguishable from nothing and WCNSS's 31 mA is real. The 245.9 mA baseline
also lands on the previously documented 248 mA idle-screen-off figure, which is
a useful independent check that the rig is measuring what it claims.

Two conclusions. **Holding the ADSP up is free**, so the sensors and the audio
transport cost nothing at idle and there is no reason to tear them down for
power. **WCNSS costs about 31 mA**, 13% of idle - real, but it is WiFi being up
rather than a bug, and worth remembering that power save is deliberately off
(see [[xperia-z1c-wifi-fix]]), which may be part of that.

**And the headline: with both DSPs stopped, 214 mA remains.** That is 87% of the
idle draw untouched, so there is no cheap win hiding in the peripherals - the
draw really is the SoC never collapsing, exactly as the analysis below argues.
It does mean the deep-suspend prize is now quantified rather than assumed.

**A correction to the plan below.** Sleep-set votes are described further down as
"the cheapest first experiment by a wide margin". They are cheap to write and
**impossible to validate**: the RPM applies the sleep set only when the APSS
signals it has entered sleep, and nothing here ever does. `spm.c`'s
`spm_match_table` carries `qcom,msm8974-saw2-v2.1-cpu` but **no `-l2` entry**, so
the `saw_l2` node the DT describes at `f9012000` is never programmed, and
cpuidle offers only per-core `cpu-spc`. Other SoCs in that table (8976, 8998,
sdm660) do have L2 variants with their own `spm_reg_data`; msm8974 does not.
So the votes would never fire, and doing this properly means the L2 SPM data,
something to drive cluster-level idle, and `platform_suspend_ops` - and
`arch/arm/mach-qcom` no longer has a `pm.c` at all.

**Measured 2026-09-14, and the answer is that this is worth doing.**

| state | current | real runtime |
|---|---|---|
| suspended (s2idle) | **156 mA** | 11.2 h |
| idle, screen off | 248 mA | 7.1 h |
| idle, screen on | 400 mA | 4.4 h |

s2idle removes only **37%** of the draw, because the cores collapse and the SoC does
not. 156 mA of standby is dire for this class of phone - a real suspend should be
single-digit milliamps - and the gap between those two numbers is the whole prize:
roughly 11 hours of standby against several days.

**And the pack is at about 56% health,** ~1750 mAh against 3140 nameplate. Phase A of
that run consumed a measured 166.2 mAh while the OCV curve said 9.48% of the pack had
gone. Every runtime figure recorded before this was optimistic by ~1.8x; the currents
were right, the divisor was not. Worth knowing before attributing any future
improvement to software.

Method matters here and is written up in [[xperia-z1c-battery-baseline]] - in short,
`capacity` is OCV-derived from instantaneous voltage so it tracks *load* rather than
charge, every endpoint has to be read at a matched load, and the conversion needs
Sony's OCV table because voltage is not linear in charge over this range. The raw
data and the derivation are in `docs/measurements/s2idle-2026-09-14/`, and the
script that produced them is `tools/s2idle-test.sh`, so the run can be repeated
against any future suspend work rather than re-invented.

## Phase 3: audio

Surveyed properly, and the shape of the work is now known rather than guessed.

**The hardware**, from stock's device tree: the codec is `taiko_codec`,
`compatible = "qcom,taiko-slim-pgd"` - a **WCD9320 (Taiko) on SLIMbus**. The bus is
`slim@fe12f000`, `qcom,slim-ngd`, reg `0xfe12f000` (0x35000) and `0xfe104000`
(0x20000). The card is `qcom,msm8974-audio-taiko`, with the usual pile of
`qcom,msm-dai-q6-sb-*` SLIMbus DAIs and a quaternary MI2S.

**What mainline has:** APR over SMD (`qcom,apr-v2`), the full Q6 stack
(`q6core`/`q6afe`/`q6asm`/`q6adm`/`q6routing`), the SLIMbus core, an NGD controller
(`qcom,slim-ngd-v1.5.0` for 8996, `-v2.1.0` for SDM845) and a non-NGD one for
apq8064.

**What mainline does not have: a WCD9320 driver.** The codecs present are wcd9335,
wcd934x, wcd937x/938x/939x - all later parts. That is the blocker, and it is a large
one; nothing downstream of it can make sound without it.

So the work splits into three milestones, and only the first two are small:

1. **APR and the Q6 services - done, booted and working.** `0039` adds the `apr` node
   under the ADSP's existing `smd-edge`, the same edge `qcom_smgr` already uses for
   sensors, with `q6core`, `q6afe`, `q6asm` and `q6adm`. Needs `CONFIG_QCOM_APR` and
   the `SND_SOC_QDSP6_*` symbols. Booted as r83:

        remoteproc remoteproc2: remote processor adsp is now up
        qcom,apr ...: Adding APR/GPR dev: aprsvc:service:4:3    (q6core)
        qcom,apr ...: Adding APR/GPR dev: aprsvc:service:4:4    (q6afe)
        qcom,apr ...: Adding APR/GPR dev: aprsvc:service:4:7    (q6asm)
        qcom,apr ...: Adding APR/GPR dev: aprsvc:service:4:8    (q6adm)

   The transport to the DSP works. No sound card appears, which is expected with no
   codec driver.

   **One thing was left over from it:**

        q6asm-dai ...:dais: No dais found in DT
        q6asm-dai ...:dais: probe with driver q6asm-dai failed with error -22

   `0039` declares the `dais` containers but not their children, and `q6asm-dai`
   counts them with `of_get_child_count()` and returns `-EINVAL` on zero. On the
   boards that work, the `dai@N` nodes live in the *board* DTS rather than the SoC
   dtsi - `msm8916-modem-qdsp6.dtsi` is the closest-in-era example - because they
   describe how many streams the board wants, not anything the SoC fixes.

   **`0041` adds them to amami's `.dts`,** four frontend DAIs matching msm8916's set:
   MULTIMEDIA1 playback, MULTIMEDIA2 capture, MULTIMEDIA3 playback, MULTIMEDIA4
   compressed. `reg` is a session id and `q6asm.h` caps `MAX_SESSIONS` at 8, so they
   have to stay inside MULTIMEDIA1..8 - the driver skips any child outside that
   without saying so.

   Only `q6asm` needs this. `q6afe-dai` builds its DAI list from
   `q6dsp_audio_ports_set_config()` rather than from DT children, so it probes fine
   with an empty container, and `q6core`/`q6adm` have no DAIs at all.

   **SOLVED 2026-09-15, booted as r84 and verified on the device.** `q6asm-dai` is
   bound - the symlink exists under `/sys/bus/platform/drivers/q6asm-dai/` - and
   `/sys/kernel/debug/asoc/dais` lists `MultiMedia1`..`MultiMedia4`, the four this
   patch declares, alongside q6afe's backend DAIs (`SLIMBUS_*`, `HDMI`, `USB_RX`).
   The `No dais found in DT` failure is gone.

   Check the binding and the DAI list rather than the absence of the error message:
   a driver that never probed at all also logs nothing.
2. **SLIMbus - SOLVED 2026-09-15. The Taiko enumerates.** `0042`-`0044`, in the
   build as r85 and flashed.

        SLIM SAT: Rcvd master capability
        SLIM controller Registered
        /sys/bus/slimbus/devices/217:a0:0:0     the interface device
        /sys/bus/slimbus/devices/217:a0:1:0     the PGD

   The controller was the easy half. Both NGD compatibles mainline already had
   point at the *same* `ngd_v1_5_offset_info`, so the version in the name carries
   no register differences at all and `qcom,slim-ngd-v1.4.0` is simply a third
   entry against the same data (`0042`). `0043` adds the bus and its BAM to the
   SoC dtsi, every address and interrupt taken from stock's own `slim@fe12f000`:
   `0xfe12f000 0x35000` and `0xfe104000 0x20000`, SPI 163 and 164. The ADSP owns
   the bus and the AP is a satellite on it, so the BAM is `qcom,controlled-remotely`
   on execution environment 1 of 2, as on 8996.

   `0044` declares the Taiko. Both enumeration addresses come from stock's
   `taiko_codec`, which stores them as the raw 6-byte `struct slim_eaddr` -
   `__packed`, little-endian, `{ instance, dev_index, prod_code, manf_id }`:

        elemental-addr                   = 00 01 a0 00 17 02   the PGD
        qcom,cdc-slim-ifd-elemental-addr = 00 00 a0 00 17 02   the interface dev

   so both are manufacturer `0x217` product `0xa0`, differing only in device
   index, which mainline spells `compatible = "slim217,a0"` with `reg = <1 0>`
   and `<0 0>`. The two device names that appear are those values read back.

   **Nothing binds to them, and that is expected** - mainline has wcd9335 and
   later, not the WCD9320. Milestone 3 is the codec driver.

   **A wrong turn worth keeping, because it nearly became a fact.** The first
   attempt concluded "the ADSP advertises no QMI services" and it was written up
   that way. It was an artefact of `tools/qrtr-services.py` guessing the QRTR
   command numbers: `NEW_SERVER` and `NEW_LOOKUP` are **4** and **10** in
   `include/uapi/linux/qrtr.h`, not 2 and 7, so the probe sent `HELLO` and
   `RESUME_TX` and heard nothing back. The script now publishes a fake service and
   checks its own lookup finds it before reporting, which is what caught it - and
   with the right constants the phone reports 36 services with `0x301` among them.
   There is no known-good QMI service here to check a probe against, since wcn36xx
   uses `WCNSS_CTRL` over SMD, so a probe that cannot test itself is worth nothing.

   **Reload the driver by rebooting, not `rmmod`.** `of_qcom_slim_ngd_register()`
   leaves its `qcom,slim-ngd.1` platform device behind on remove, so a second
   `modprobe` dies on `kobject_add_internal failed ... -EEXIST` and the controller
   never probes again. Looks like a SLIMbus failure and is not one.

3. **The WCD9320 driver - it already exists, and it compiles.** `0049`.

   **Do not write this from scratch.** `msm8974-mainline/linux` carries a Taiko
   driver on branch `old-4.18.0/qcom-audio-wip`: `wcd9320.c`, `wcd9320.h`,
   `wcd9320-registers.h`, `wcd9320-regmap.c`, `wcd9320-slim.c`, plus `wcd-clsh.c`
   and `wcd-slim.h`. 8252 lines, and checking for it took one API call against
   several sessions of writing.

   **It forward-ports to 6.16 in nine small changes**, which is the surprise - it
   was written after the `snd_soc_codec` to `snd_soc_component` conversion, so the
   one genuinely painful ASoC migration was already done. What it needed:

   - `#include <linux/of_platform.h>` for `of_platform_populate()`
   - `snd_soc_component_read32()` -> `snd_soc_component_read()`, 21 sites, same
     signature and return semantics
   - the `WCD9335_IS_1_1`/`IS_2_0` macros, which `wcd-clsh.c` reaches for because
     it is shared with the WCD9335 in its home tree. Carried in `wcd-clsh.h`
     rather than pulling in a wcd9335 header. **Both are dead code here**: the
     WCD9320 never assigns `codec_version` - the assignment is commented out
     upstream - so it stays 0, `WCD9335_VERSION_1_0`, and neither macro matches.
   - `slim_stream_config` lost its `prot` field; the assignment is dropped
   - `slim_stream_allocate()` takes a name now, and the config goes to
     `slim_stream_prepare()`
   - `set_channel_map`/`get_channel_map` gained `const` qualifiers, propagated
     into `mywcd_slim_init_slimslave()`
   - `platform_driver::remove` returns void
   - a missing `return ret` in `mywcd_slim_init_slimslave()`
   - the two halves each had a module entry point, which does not link when they
     are one module. The SLIMbus half now owns `module_init`/`module_exit` and
     registers the platform driver too, which matches the order things have to
     happen in anyway: the slim probe is what calls `of_platform_populate()` to
     create the device the codec driver binds to.
   - `MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(slim, ...)` was missing, so it could never autoload

   **Its device ID table is `{0x217, 0xa0, 0x1, 0x0}` and `{0x217, 0xa0, 0x0, 0x0}`
   - exactly the two addresses already enumerating on this phone's bus**, and the
   built module carries `alias: slim:217:a0:*`. It is aimed at this hardware.

   **Built as r88 and deliberately NOT flashed.** The module autoloads on that
   alias, and there is no DT node for it yet, so probing it on the phone is a
   fresh-session job rather than a 3am one.

   **`0050` wires it into amami's DT**, every value read out of stock with
   `tools/romdtb.py`: reset on msmgpio 63, the interrupt on msmgpio 72 (stock's
   `wcd9xxx-irq`, named `cdc-int`), the MCLK gate on PM8941 GPIO 15, and
   `qcom,cdc-mclk-clk-rate` `0x927c00` - 9.6MHz, which is CXO/2, so
   `RPM_SMD_DIV_CLK1`. Stock's phandles put the buck rail on S2, tx-h/rx-h/px-1
   on S3 and the three 1.2V rails on L1; the driver asks for them under its own
   names (`vdd-buck`, `vdd-tx-h` ...), so the mapping is by phandle, not by name.

   **It also needs `ifd = <&taiko_ifd>;`.** `wcd9320_slim_probe()` looks the
   interface device up by that phandle, and without it the PGD half stops at
   `No Interface device found` - which is exactly what the first attempt did.

   **`0051`** adds `qcom,msm8974-sndcard` to `sound/soc/qcom/apq8096.c`. That
   driver is 145 lines and entirely generic - `qcom_snd_parse_of()` builds the
   card from the DT dai-links - and its one SoC-specific constant, a 9.6MHz codec
   MCLK, is the rate the Taiko wants too.

   **How far it gets, as of 2026-09-16.** The codec probes and talks to the
   hardware:

        gonna write
        ragmap ret: 0            <- a register write over SLIMbus succeeded
        WCDPROBESTART
        WCD PROBE!! YAY
        WCD OSC Freq: 70
        WCD dai 0 .. WCD dai 9   <- ten DAIs registered

   and `/sys/kernel/debug/asoc/components` lists the codec beside q6routing and
   the q6asm/q6afe DAI sets.

   **`0052` fixes the oops, and there is now a sound card.** See below; what
   follows is how the crash was found, kept because the method transfers.

   **The oops it used to hit:**

        Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0
        PC is at dapm_connect_mux+0x2c/0xec
        LR is at snd_soc_dapm_add_path+0x184/0x3f4

   `dapm_connect_mux()` starts with `&w->kcontrol_news[0]` and immediately reads
   `e->reg` through it, so a sink widget with a NULL `kcontrol_news` faults there.
   None of the nine `SND_SOC_DAPM_MUX` widgets in `wcd9320.c` is declared with a
   NULL control, so the likely cause is a route whose sink resolves to a widget
   that is not a mux - plausibly one crossing into q6routing's DAPM rather than
   the codec's own. **That is the next thing to chase**, and printing the route
   being added when it faults is the cheap way in.

   **How it was found, without rebuilding the kernel.** `CONFIG_SND_SOC=y`, so
   adding a printk to the core would have cost a flash cycle per guess. Instead
   `CONFIG_KPROBE_EVENTS=y` is on - mount `tracefs` and ask the running kernel:

        mount -t tracefs nodev /sys/kernel/tracing
        echo 'p:dcm dapm_connect_mux ctrl=+0(%r2):string wname=+0(+4(%r3)):string' \
            > /sys/kernel/tracing/kprobe_events
        echo 1 > /sys/kernel/tracing/events/kprobes/dcm/enable

   `$arg1`-style arguments do **not** work on arm32 - it needs the
   `HAVE_FUNCTION_ARG_ACCESS_API` the architecture lacks - so use the registers:
   `%r2` is `dapm_connect_mux()`'s third argument and `%r3` its fourth, and
   `+4(%r3)` is `snd_soc_dapm_widget::name`, `id` being the u32 in front of it.
   Three lines came out, and the last was the fault:

        ctrl="AIF1_PB" wname="SLIM RX1 MUX"   <- fine
        ctrl="AIF1_PB" wname="SLIM RX2 MUX"   <- faulted

   **The bug.** `slim_rx_mux[]` is declared `[WCD9320_RX_MAX]`, thirteen entries,
   and filled with **two**, from index 0. The widgets index it by `WCD9320_RX1`
   through `RX7` - one through seven - so `SLIM RX1 MUX` got the valid entry at
   index 1 and `SLIM RX2 MUX` got zeroed memory at index 2. `dapm_connect_mux()`
   casts that entry's `private_value` to a `struct soc_enum` and reads `e->reg`
   off it immediately, which is the NULL dereference at address 0.

   A second bug sat underneath: index 1 holds the control *named* "SLIM RX2 Mux",
   so even the working widget had the wrong control - the array was off by one
   against the enum it is indexed by. `0052` fixes both with designated
   initializers for `RX1`..`RX7`.

   **What works now.** Loading the fixed codec gives a card:

        0 [Compact        ]: apq8096 - Xperia Z1 Compact
        /dev/snd/pcmC0D0p

   and `speaker-test -D hw:0,0` runs the whole chain - the DSP takes the stream,
   SLIMbus channels are prepared and enabled, MCLK and the master bias come up,
   and the codec's RX path activates:

        wcd9320_set_interpolator_rate: AIF_PB DAI(0) connected to RX2, 48000
        wcd_slim_stream_prepare / wcd_slim_stream_enable
        wcd9320_codec_enable_mclk -> enable_master_bias -> enable_mclk
        wcd9320_codec_enable_rx_bias / wcd9320_codec_enable_slimrx

   **It is silent, and the reason is known.** Tested with headphones in the jack
   and the routing set by hand: the stream runs to completion and nothing is
   heard. The log says why:

        qcom,slim-ngd: Tx:MT:0x0, MC:0x60, LA:0x0 failed:-110
        ASoC error (-5) at snd_soc_component_update_bits() ... register [0x00000b56]

   `0xb56` is in the **interface device's** register space - the SLIMbus port
   configuration - and those writes are going to **logical address 0**, because
   the interface device never gets one:

        wcd9320-slim 217:a0:0:0: Failed to get logical address

   So the ports are never configured, no audio data crosses the bus, and the
   stream plays into nothing. The PGD is fine - its regmap write returns 0 at
   probe - which is why everything upstream reports success.

   **`0053` fixes the addressing, and the timeouts are gone.** The interface
   device does not answer on the bus until the codec's digital core is running,
   and `wcd9320_bring_up()` is what starts it (`A_CDC_CTL` 0 then 3). Asking for
   its logical address *after* bring-up succeeds; the
   `Tx:MT:0x0, MC:0x60, LA:0x0 failed:-110` timeouts disappear. Not fatal if it
   fails, as `wcd9335` also ignores the result.

   **Asking before bring-up makes it worse**, which is what the first attempt did:
   both devices then fail to get an address and no card appears at all,
   reproducibly across a module reload. Order is the whole point.

   **What is still silent, and why - `wcd-clsh.c` is for the wrong codec.**
   Register `0xb56` still fails, now as a plain `-EIO` rather than a timeout, and
   it is not an interface-device register at all:

        wcd-clsh.c:10: #define WCD9XXX_A_CDC_RX1_RX_PATH_CFG0  (0xB56)

   **All twenty** register addresses in `wcd-clsh.c` are `>= 0x400`, and the
   WCD9320's whole map ends at `WCD9320_NUM_REGISTERS` = `0x400`. They are
   WCD9335 addresses: that file is shared between the two codecs in its home tree
   and was only ever correct for the WCD9335. Every Class-H write a Taiko makes
   through it is out of range and rejected, so the Class-H block and the
   headphone output path are never configured - which is exactly why the stream
   runs and nothing is heard.

   The Taiko has its own Class-H block - 36 `WCD9320_A_CDC_CLSH_*` registers from
   `0x320` - and its own headphone registers at `0x1AE`/`0x1B1`. `0054` stubs
   `wcd_clsh_fsm()` out rather than writing at random; Class-H is a power
   optimisation, not a prerequisite for sound.

   **Class-H was not the only thing, and nor was the addressing.** With `0053`,
   `0054` and `0055` in, **every codec register write succeeds, no SLIMbus
   transaction fails, and it is still completely silent.**

   `0055` is a real bug worth knowing about: `wcd9320_ifd_regmap_config` had **no
   `max_register`**, which regmap defaults to 0 - so the interface device's map
   permitted exactly register 0 and silently rejected every port write (the
   enables at `0x30`, the config bytes, the channel registers at
   `0x100 + 4*port`). Its debugfs dump was one line. It now covers 1024.

   **What the hardware says.** Read back while a tone plays, the whole path is up:

        DAPM: SLIM RX1, RX1 MIX1, RX1 INTERP, CLASS_H_DSM MUX, HPHL DAC, HPHL - all On
        0x1ab = 0xb0   HPHL PA enable bit (0x20) set
        0x1b1 = 0xc0   HPHL DAC enable bit (0x80) set

   So the analog output stage is enabled and the digital path is powered. Nothing
   is failing. There is simply no audio arriving.

   **The prime suspect: the SLIMbus channel setup is `#if 0`-ed out.**

        wcd9320.c:2430  #if 0  wcd_slim_alloc_slim_sh_ch(..., SLIM_SINK)   RX channels
        wcd9320.c:2454  #if 0  wcd_slim_alloc_slim_sh_ch(..., SLIM_SRC)    TX channels
        wcd9320.c:2583  #if 0  the RX port config loop, channel regs + watermark

   This driver is a work in progress and that is the part left unfinished, which
   fits every observation: everything powers up, nothing errors, no data moves.

   **Those `#if 0` blocks are superseded, not missing - checked, so do not chase
   them.** The driver uses the modern `slim_stream_prepare()`/`enable()` API
   instead, and the channels really are configured. The codec reports them to the
   machine driver on every playback:

        wcd9320_get_channel_map: slot_num 0 ch->ch_num 145
        wcd9320_get_channel_map: slot_num 1 ch->ch_num 146

   With `BASE_CH_NUM` 128 those are slave ports 17 and 18, inside Taiko's RX range
   (ports 16-28, 13 of them). The register bases match downstream exactly -
   `0x180 - 16*4` and `0x040 - 16`, where downstream's
   `TAIKO_SB_PGD_OFFSET_OF_RX_SLAVE_DEV_PORTS` is also 16 - and the DSP side is
   right too: `SLIMBUS_0_RX` is 2, so `q6slim_set_channel_map()` takes its RX
   branch and stores `ch_mapping = {145, 146}`. Both ends agree.

   ### What is actually unfinished: the codec's interrupt layer

   A full playback log ends with:

        wcd9320_codec_enable_slim_chmask: Slim close tx/rx wait timeout, ch_mask:0x60000

   `0x60000` is bits 17 and 18 - precisely those two ports. `ch_mask` bits are set
   when the ports open and are meant to be cleared by the codec's SLIMbus port
   interrupt handler, which then wakes `dai_wait`. They are never cleared, and
   `/proc/interrupts` says why:

        106:  0  0  0  0  msmgpio  72  Level  wcd

   **Zero interrupts, ever.** The DT wiring is right and
   `devm_request_threaded_irq()` does run, but inside the codec:

   - `wcd9320_slimbus_irq()` is **defined and never referenced** - line 3110 is its
     only occurrence in the file. The handler that clears `ch_mask` is never
     registered.
   - `wcd->irq_data = control->irq_data;` is **commented out**, so no
     `regmap_irq_chip` is ever set up for the codec's internal interrupt
     controller and `wcd9320_request_irq()` could not work even if it were called.

   So the interrupt support simply is not implemented. That is a real piece of
   work: a `regmap_irq_chip` over the codec's `A_INTR_*` registers, then hooking
   `wcd9320_slimbus_irq` to `WCD9320_IRQ_SLIMBUS`.

   **`0056` fixes the init sequence but does not fix the interrupt.** It replaces
   the ad-hoc writes `wcd9320_bring_up()` used to end with - which masked most
   sources again - with the sequence `wcd9xxx-irq.c` uses downstream: everything
   edge triggered except SLIMBUS, which is level high, so `INTR_LEVEL0` bit 0
   set; masks are 1-to-mask, so `0xfe` on register 0 and `0xff` elsewhere; and
   `INTR_MODE` `0x02`. Worth keeping because the old writes were provably wrong,
   but the interrupt still never fires.

   **And the reason why is the next clue: some of those writes do not stick.**
   Read back afterwards:

        09c: ff   INTR_CLEAR0 - our write landed
        094: 00   INTR_MASK0  - we wrote 0xfe
        0a0: 00   INTR_LEVEL0 - we wrote 0x01

   `CLEAR0` holds, `MASK0` and `LEVEL0` do not. The likely explanation is that
   something re-initialises the cache after `wcd9320_bring_up()` runs - the codec
   platform driver probes later, and `wcd9320_regmap_config` has
   `REGCACHE_RBTREE` with a `wcd9320_defaults` table, so a `regcache_sync()` would
   write the POR values back over them. **Check that before writing an irq chip**:
   an irq chip programming the same registers would be undone the same way.

   **`0058` fixes a real bug in the handler**: it read and acknowledged only
   `INTR_STATUS0..2`, three of four registers. Anything latched in `STATUS3`
   could never be cleared, which on a level-triggered line means the codec holds
   the interrupt asserted forever. It also fixes `1 << i & 7`, which parses as
   `(1 << i) & 7` where `1 << (i & 7)` was meant.

   ### The interrupt line: what is actually known

   The pin is fine. `/sys/kernel/debug/gpio` shows:

        gpio72: in low func0 2mA pull up

   muxed to GPIO (`func0`), an input, pulled up - and sitting **low**. A pull-up
   holding low looks exactly like an asserted open-drain active-low interrupt,
   so requesting `IRQF_TRIGGER_LOW` instead of downstream's `IRQF_TRIGGER_HIGH`
   was tried. **It fires - and it is spurious.** Thousands of interrupts, and the
   handler reads every status register as zero:

        irq 106 0 0 0 0

   So the low level is not the codec reporting anything. That change is reverted;
   it bought an interrupt storm and no information. `IRQF_TRIGGER_HIGH` stands.

   **Which leaves two candidates, and they are testable.**

   1. **msmgpio 72 may not be the codec's interrupt on amami.** It came from
      stock's `wcd9xxx-irq` node (`interrupts = <0x48 0x0>`, named `cdc-int`), but
      that was read out of the stock tree rather than confirmed against this
      board. A line that idles low under a pull-up is odd for an unused input.
   2. **The codec's `0x090`-`0x0A2` block may not be reachable at all.** Writes to
      `INTR_MASK0` (`0xfe`) and `INTR_LEVEL0` (`0x01`) do not stick - both read
      back `0x00` - and all four `INTR_STATUS` registers read `0x00`, while
      `0x1ab` and `0x1b1` in the analog block read sensible values (`0xb0`,
      `0xc0`). Everything below `0x100` is marked volatile, "top level registers
      which can be written by the Taiko core driver", which hints they are
      reached differently downstream. If that block is unreachable the codec can
      never raise an interrupt, and no amount of polarity work will help.

   **Settled, and it is (2) - with a much bigger consequence than interrupts.**
   Nine registers under `0x100` have non-zero power-on values. Every one of them
   reads `0x00`:

        addr   read   POR
        0x019  0x00   0x08    HDRIVE_OVERRIDE
        0x020  0x00   0x44    ANA_CSR_WAIT_STATE
        0x040  0x00   0x80    PROCESS_MONITOR_CTL0
        0x043  0x00   0x01    PROCESS_MONITOR_CTL3
        0x094  0x00   0xff    INTR_MASK0
        0x095  0x00   0xff    INTR_MASK1
        0x096  0x00   0x3f    INTR_MASK2
        0x097  0x00   0x3f    INTR_MASK3

   The same addresses read `0x00` through the interface device's map too. Yet the
   codec is plainly alive and addressable higher up: `0x1ab` reads `0xb0` while a
   tone plays and `0x80` at idle, tracking the headphone PA enable bit exactly.
   **So the whole register block below `0x100` is unreachable, and everything at
   or above it works.**

   ### Why that matters far more than the interrupt

        #define WCD9XXX_A_CDC_CTL      (0x80)
        #define WCD9XXX_A_LEAKAGE_CTL  (0x88)

   Both are inside the dead block. `wcd9320_bring_up()` brings the codec's
   digital core out of reset by toggling `A_CDC_CTL` 0 then 3 - **and those
   writes have been going nowhere all along.** The digital core is never enabled.
   That accounts for the whole picture at once: no interrupts can be generated,
   `INTR_*` cannot be configured, the SLIMbus channel-close handshake never
   completes, and playback runs end to end in silence while every layer above
   reports success. `regmap_write()` returning 0 means the SLIMbus write was
   accepted, not that it landed anywhere.

   **SOLVED by `0059`: every register is at `0x800 + N`.** `wcd9xxx-core.c`
   downstream adds `WCD9XXX_REGISTER_START_OFFSET`, which is `0x800`, to the
   value-element offset in both its read and write helpers:

        msg.start_offset = WCD9XXX_REGISTER_START_OFFSET + reg;

   This driver passed raw register numbers to `regmap_init_slimbus()`, so every
   access landed `0x800` low. `regmap_config` has a field for exactly this -
   `reg_base`, applied in `regmap_reg_addr()` when the bus transfer is formatted,
   so `max_register` and the readable/volatile callbacks keep using the driver's
   own numbering. Adding `.reg_base = WCD9320_REGISTER_START_OFFSET` to both the
   codec and interface maps is the whole fix.

   `wcd9335` does not need it because its register constants already carry the
   page - `0xB56` and friends - which is why a plain `regmap_init_slimbus()`
   works there and hid the problem here.

   **What changed on the hardware.** The block below `0x100` now reads real
   values instead of zeros:

        019: 09   020: 44   040: 80   043: 01
        094: fe   095: ff   096: 3f   097: 7f

   `0x020`, `0x040`, `0x043`, `0x095` and `0x096` match their power-on values
   exactly, and `0x094` reads `0xfe` - which is precisely what `0056` writes to
   unmask the SLIMbus source, so driver writes are landing too. **`A_CDC_CTL` is
   `0x80`, so the codec's digital core is being brought out of reset for the
   first time.**

   And the interrupt works: `msmgpio 72` went from **0 to 888**, the handler
   decodes **786 SLIMbus port interrupts** during a playback, and there are no
   errors anywhere on the path.

   ### What is left

   The channel-close handshake still times out, and now for a simple reason:
   `wcd9320_slimbus_irq()` - the function that clears `ch_mask` and wakes
   `dai_wait` - is still never registered. The slim-side `irq_handler()` receives
   the port interrupts and clears the port status, but nothing clears `ch_mask`.
   Wiring those together is the next job, and it is now a small one.

   **SOLVED by `0060`: the port interrupt now reaches the codec half, and the
   close handshake completes.** The two halves are separate drivers over one piece
   of silicon, and only the slim half owns the interrupt line, so there was no way
   for a port interrupt to reach the code that knows about DAIs: `struct wcd9320`
   held no pointer to `struct wcd9320_priv`. The link goes in the one structure
   both halves already share, `struct wcd_slim_data` - a `codec_priv` field the
   component probe publishes with `smp_store_release()` *after* it has
   `init_waitqueue_head()`'d every `dai_wait`, and retracts on remove. The slim
   handler then loads it with `smp_load_acquire()` and calls
   `wcd9320_slimbus_irq()`.

   **It replaces the slim side's own port decode rather than running after it.**
   That ordering is the whole point: the codec handler repeats the same four
   status reads, and reading them first would have handed it four zeroed registers
   and left the handshake timing out exactly as before. The slim side's inline
   decode is what produced the 786 decoded port interrupts under `0059`, and it
   was still useless, because clearing port status is not what
   `wcd9320_codec_enable_slim_chmask()` waits on - `dai->ch_mask` is.

   **Measured, three consecutive runs on r101:** `Slim close tx/rx wait timeout`
   does not appear once, where before it appeared on every playback. One interrupt
   per run, no storm, no `Couldn't find slimbus ... port` warnings.

   **`0060` also sweeps up the acknowledge.** The codec handler has an early
   `continue` for a port whose interrupt is not enabled, and that path skips the
   per-port `INT_CLR` write at the bottom of its own loop. The line is level
   triggered, so a status bit nobody acknowledged holds it asserted and it re-fires
   without end - the same storm `IRQF_TRIGGER_LOW` produced on its own before the
   status registers were being cleared properly (4427 interrupts, all registers
   reading zero). The slim half now re-reads the four status registers after the
   call and clears whatever is left, which is what it used to do unconditionally.
   This has not been observed to trigger; it is there so the door stays shut.

   **Still not audible, and there is a concrete next lead: overflow.** Every
   playback logs

        wcd9320_slimbus_irq: overflow error on RX port 1, value 5
        wcd9320_slimbus_irq: overflow error on RX port 2, value 5

   `value 5` is `OVERFLOW | PORT_CLOSED`. An overflow on an *RX* port means data is
   arriving that the codec is not consuming, which is what silence would look like
   from the bus's side, so this is worth chasing before anything else.

   **And overflow can still swallow a close, in one specific case.** The handler
   *disables* a port's interrupt on overflow, the way downstream does, to stop an
   overflow storm. When both bits arrive in the same interrupt (`value 5`) the
   close is handled in the same pass and nothing is lost. But on the very first
   playback after `modprobe`, before the routing above is applied, overflow arrives
   *alone* (`value 1`) in an earlier interrupt, masks the port, and the later
   port-closed event then has no enabled interrupt to arrive on - which is the one
   remaining `close tx/rx wait timeout` in the boot log, at 69.6 s. Fixing the
   overflow should make this moot; if it does not, the mask needs to be narrowed so
   it cannot cost a close.

   **Whether that alone restores audio is not proven.** The SLIMbus data path is
   hardware and interrupts are status reporting, so it is possible sound needs
   something further. But it is the one concrete unimplemented subsystem left on
   the path, and the close timeout is direct evidence it matters.

   **It did not restore audio, and the remaining fault is now pinned down
   precisely.** During playback the SLIMbus RX ports sit in *permanent*,
   continuously-asserted overflow. The probe that establishes this, and its
   control, matter more than the conclusion:

        (stream running)  write INT_CLR_RX_0 = 0xff
                          read  INT_STATUS_RX_0  ->  0x06   immediately
        (no stream)       write INT_CLR_RX_0 = 0xff
                          read  INT_STATUS_RX_0  ->  0x00   and stays 0x00

   The clear works; the condition just re-asserts inside a single register read.
   So the codec is not draining slowly or drifting out of sync - it consumes
   **nothing at all**, from the first sample. And since a sink can only overflow
   if something is filling it, the SLIMbus transport and the ADSP side are both
   working. That is the useful half of this finding: everything up to and
   including delivery into the codec is correct, and the fault is entirely
   inside the codec's own consumption of the port.

   **Live register writes now work on this build**, which is what made the rest
   of this possible - `9000-debug-regmap-allow-write-debugfs.patch` is in the
   recipe, so both codec regmaps take writes:

        /sys/kernel/debug/regmap/217:a0:1:0/registers   PGD, the codec proper
        /sys/kernel/debug/regmap/217:a0:0:0/registers   IFD, the SLIM ports

        echo "3ae 28" | sudo tee /sys/kernel/debug/regmap/217:a0:1:0/registers

   Prefer this over another build for anything register-shaped.

   **Ruled out by live experiment - each one poked to its downstream value mid
   playback, each one no change whatsoever:**

   - *Class-H, buck, NCP and the charge pump.* The whole downstream HPH enable
     sequence was replayed by hand (`CLK_OTHR_CTL`=0x01, `BUCK_MODE_1`=0xa5 with
     bit 7 set, `NCP_EN`=0xff, `CLSH_B1_CTL`=0xa7, plus both param tables).
     Overflow identical before and after. This was the leading hypothesis -
     `0054` disables Class-H and the rails really are off at POR - and it is
     **wrong**. Worth knowing before anyone spends a day porting `wcd-clsh.c`:
     it is still the right thing to do for power and probably for audibility,
     but it is not what is stopping the data.
   - *SLIM RX port sample width.* Both as a live poke and, in `0061`, as a
     proper fix in its correct place before the stream opens.
   - *Mixer input routing.* The data lands on slave ports 17 and 18, which are
     internal mixer inputs **RX2 and RX3**, not RX1/RX2 - `rx_mix1_inp =
     ch->port + RX_MIX1_INP_SEL_RX1 - 16` and `RX_MIX1_INP_SEL_RX1` is 5. So the
     routing recipe further up aims `RX1 MIX1 INP1` at a port carrying nothing.
     Pointing the mixers at the ports that do carry data (`CONN_RX1_B1_CTL`=0x06,
     `CONN_RX2_B1_CTL`=0x07) changes nothing about the overflow either, but the
     recipe is still wrong and that is worth remembering when reading old logs -
     it explains the lone `AIF_PB DAI(0) connected to RX2` line.

   **Verified correct, so do not re-check these:**

   - Stream config, read straight out of `slim_stream_prepare` with a kprobe:
     `rate=48000 bps=16 chc=2 pm=0x60000 dir=0`. `dir=0` is playback, which is
     what makes the core send CONNECT_SINK.
   - Interpolator rate: `RX1/RX2_B5_CTL` bits 7:5 = 0x60 = 48 kHz. The port
     writes `comp_fs << 5` where downstream passes a separate `rx_fs_rate`, but
     the two tables line up at **every** rate (8k/16k/32k/48k/96k/192k ->
     0x00/0x20/0x40/0x60/0x80/0xA0), so the conflation is harmless.
   - Port config `0x41`/`0x42` = 0x05 = `WATER_MARK_12BYTES | SLAVE_PORT_ENABLE`,
     and the channel map `0x184`/`0x188` = 0x06. Both match downstream, which
     computes that payload over the whole channel list and writes it to every
     port in the group.
   - `A_CDC_CTL`=0x03, `CLK_RX_B1_CTL`=0x03, `CLK_MCLK_CTL`=0x01, and every DAPM
     widget from `AIF1 PB` through `SLIM RX1/2`, the mixers, interpolators,
     `RX1/2 CHAIN`, the DACs and `HEADPHONE` reads `On`.

   **`0062` fixes one more real divergence, and does not fix the overflow.**
   Downstream activates the SLIMbus channel from the SLIM RX widget's
   `SND_SOC_DAPM_POST_PMU`, as the last thing `taiko_codec_enable_slimrx()` does.
   This port called `slim_stream_enable()` from the DAI's `prepare` callback
   instead, and ALSA runs `hw_params` -> DAI `prepare` -> and only then does
   `soc_pcm_prepare()` raise `SND_SOC_DAPM_STREAM_START`. So the ADSP began
   filling the slave port while the codec's RX chain was still powered down.
   That looked like an exact explanation for a port that overflows from the
   first sample. **It is not:** with the ordering corrected the overflow is
   unchanged, measured with the PCM confirmed `RUNNING` throughout. What it does
   fix is the last surviving close timeout - the one on the first playback after
   `modprobe`, which `0060` could not reach because the overflow arrived alone
   and masked the port before the close. Total close timeouts since boot is now
   **0**.

   **A trap worth naming, because it produced a wrong answer for several
   minutes.** A clean overflow status and a stopped stream look *identical* -
   both read `INT_STATUS_RX_0 = 0x00`. One run of the probe appeared to show the
   overflow clearing after `0062` and it was briefly believed to be the fix; it
   was not reproducible, and re-running with `pgrep speaker-test` and
   `/proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/sub0/status` asserted alongside every reading showed
   `state: RUNNING` with `0x06` on every probe. Any overflow probe must carry a
   liveness check, the same way the proximity work needed a control sensor.

   **`0063` removes a real off-by-one that had the driver reading a port nobody
   fed.** Downstream's port enum starts at `TAIKO_RX1 = 0` and there is no
   `TAIKO_RX0`; this port invented one, which shifted every RX index up by one.
   `"SLIM RX1 MUX"` carries its index in the widget's shift field and
   `slim_rx_mux_put()` uses it to pick `rx_chs[]`, so the mux named RX1 was
   subscribing `rx_chs[1]` - slave port **17** - while the mixer in front of it
   wrote `RX_MIX1_INP_SEL_RX1` for the enum text "RX1", and that value selects
   slave port **16**. The DAPM route `{"RX1 MIX1 INP1", "RX1", "SLIM RX1"}`
   asserts those are the same port; they were not. With the enum renumbered the
   channel map moves from 145/146 to 144/145 and the overflow moves from ports
   1/2 to ports 0/1, which is the shift made visible.

   **It is still not the cause.** With everything self-consistent for the first
   time - mixer reading port 16, data arriving on port 16, whole path powered,
   `1ab=a0 1b1=c0` - the port overflows exactly as before, `status=0x03` on every
   probe with the PCM confirmed `RUNNING`. Keep the patch: it is correct, it
   matches downstream, and a future session should not have to find it again.

   **Also worth knowing: the DAPM route table is incomplete.** Only the identity
   routes exist -

        {"RX1 MIX1 INP1", "RX1", "SLIM RX1"},
        {"RX2 MIX1 INP1", "RX2", "SLIM RX2"},

   so selecting any other input, such as `RX1 MIX1 INP1 = RX2`, connects to
   nothing and the entire chain stays powered down - `1ab=80 1b1=40`, no widgets
   on. That is a silent failure mode: the routing commands all succeed, `amixer`
   reports the new value, and the only symptom is that nothing powers up.
   Downstream carries the full cross-connect. Anyone testing alternative routing
   must check the DAPM power state, not just the control value.

   **`0061` and `0063` interact, and the net answer is `0x0a`.** `0061` argued
   the sample-width register should be `0x28` because a stereo stream lands on SB
   ports 1 and 2. That was true *under the broken numbering*. With `0063` the
   stream lands on SB ports 0 and 1, so the correct value is
   `(0x2 << 0) | (0x2 << 2)` = **`0x0a`** - which is exactly what the old
   hardcoded write produced. The hardcoded value was right by accident and the
   enum was the thing that was wrong. `0061` is still worth keeping, because it
   derives the field per channel instead of assuming stereo, but its commit
   message names a value that no longer applies. The register reads `0x3ae =
   0x0a` on the phone now, which is correct.

   **Four more things ruled out, with the ordering objection answered.** A fair
   criticism of the earlier live pokes is that they were all applied *after* the
   overflow had already latched, so a negative proved nothing. That objection has
   now been tested and does not save any of them:

   - *Class-H and the rails, set before the stream starts.* Written while idle
     (`CLK_OTHR_CTL`=0x01, `BUCK_MODE_1`=0xa5, `NCP_EN`=0xff), confirmed still
     set during playback, overflow unchanged. This is the properly-ordered
     version of the earlier test and it agrees.
   - *The port is not latched.* Bouncing the slave port's enable bit
     (`PORT_CFG` 0x05 -> 0x04 -> 0x05) with the RX chain already up and clearing
     the status while disabled does not make it drain. So the port is not stuck
     in an error state from the early overflow; it is simply never read.
   - *Every value downstream sets is already set.* All four downstream tables
     (`taiko_reg_defaults`, `taiko_1_0_`, `taiko_2_0_`, `taiko_codec_reg_init_val`)
     were parsed, mapped onto our register names and diffed against a live dump
     taken during playback: **zero mismatches**. The missing piece is not a
     register value.
   - *The write order is now captured.* The `regmap:regmap_reg_write` tracepoint
     works, so a whole playback can be recorded:

        echo 1 > /sys/kernel/tracing/events/regmap/regmap_reg_write/enable

     An entire playback is only 27 writes to the PGD and 11 to the interface
     device. Note the trace shows *changes* only - regmap skips writes that match
     the cache - so an absent register is not necessarily an unwritten one.

   **What the trace does show** is the interface device being configured and
   enabled (`0x180`/`0x40`, `0x184`/`0x41`) early, the overflow handler masking
   both ports (`INT_EN0` -> `0xfc`) within milliseconds, and only *then* the RX
   chain coming up - reset pulse at `0x301`, interpolator clock at `0x30f`, DAC,
   PA. That ordering is inherent to DAPM, which powers source-to-sink, and
   downstream has the same shape, so it is expected rather than wrong. What is
   wrong is that the port never recovers once the interpolator does start.

   **The codec is being fed the wrong master clock, and that is almost certainly
   why nothing drains.** Every register on the path is right because register
   access rides the SLIMbus clock and does not need MCLK at all - which is
   exactly why months of register comparison found nothing. Measured on the
   phone:

        /sys/kernel/debug/clk/div_clk1/clk_rate          19200000
        qcom,codec-clk-rate (DT)                          9600000
        A_CHIP_CTL 0x06                                       0x02  = 9.6MHz

   `wcd9320_parse_dt()` calls `clk_set_rate(clk, 9600000)` and **ignores the
   return value**. A kretprobe shows the call returns **0, success**, while the
   rate never changes. The reason is in mainline:

        DEFINE_CLK_SMD_RPM_XO_BUFFER(div_clk1, 11, 19200000);

        static const struct clk_ops clk_smd_rpm_branch_ops = {
                .prepare, .unprepare, .recalc_rate      /* no .set_rate */
        };

   With no `.set_rate` and no `.determine_rate`, the clock core decides the rate
   is already correct and returns success without touching anything. So the DT
   comment on the codec node - "9.6MHz, which is CXO/2 and so RPM_SMD_DIV_CLK1" -
   was wrong twice: that clock is CXO itself, 19.2MHz, and it cannot be divided.
   A Taiko accepts **only** 9.6 or 12.288MHz, so it is running at exactly twice
   its configured clock, or not running at all.

   **The intended fix, and why it is not in the tree.** Mainline has the right
   driver for this - `SPMI_PMIC_CLKDIV`, whose help text says "it configures the
   frequency of clkdiv outputs of the PMIC. These clocks are typically wired
   through alternate functions on GPIO pins." That is this board: stock's
   `qcom,cdc-mclk-gpios` is PM8941 GPIO 15. The driver divides the 19.2MHz XO by
   powers of two - 9.6MHz is one step - and unlike the RPM clock it implements
   `.set_rate`. The binding's own example even assigns 9600000.

   The attempt added a `qcom,spmi-clkdiv` node at `0x5b00` under `pm8941_0`,
   pointed the codec's `clocks` at `<&pm8941_clk_divs 1>` with
   `assigned-clock-rates = <9600000>`, muxed GPIO 15 to `function = "func1"`
   through the codec's own `pinctrl-0`, stopped the driver claiming that pin as
   an ordinary GPIO (`gpio_request()` muxes it straight back to "normal", so held
   high it carries DC and not a clock), and set `CONFIG_SPMI_PMIC_CLKDIV=y`.

   **It hung the boot.** The phone did not enumerate on USB at all - not the
   network gadget, not fastboot - so it hangs before USB comes up, which is
   earlier than a failed codec probe would explain. Reverted; the boot image was
   restored from `boot-images/boot-r90.img` over fastboot and the modules rebuilt
   without it. Zero close timeouts afterwards, no regression.

   **If you pick this up, narrow it before flashing again.** The change did five
   things at once and any of them could be the one that hangs. Split them: the
   `CONFIG_SPMI_PMIC_CLKDIV=y` driver alone with no DT node at all is inert and
   safe to boot first; then the clkdiv node alone with nothing consuming it; then
   the pin mux; and only then move the codec's `clocks` over. Which of the three
   CLKDIV peripherals (`0x5b00`, `0x5c00`, `0x5d00`) actually reaches GPIO 15 is
   also unverified - the codec was pointed at the first one on the reasoning that
   CLKDIV1 is the usual audio MCLK, and that is a guess. There is no SPMI regmap
   in debugfs on this build, so the PMIC's clkdiv registers could not be read to
   check; adding one would settle it without a single reboot.

   **Recovery, since it will probably be needed again.** Power off with
   **Power + Volume Up** (a ten-second power hold does nothing on this phone), then
   hold Volume Up while plugging USB - the LED turns blue for fastboot - then
   `fastboot flash boot boot-images/boot-r90.img` and `fastboot reboot`. Note the
   modules in the rootfs may be newer than the restored kernel; `pkgver` is
   `6.16.12` for every build so they still load, but rebuild and reinstall the
   matching package afterwards or the two halves disagree.

   **Correction: that 19.2MHz is not a measurement, and the clock is probably
   fine.** `/sys/kernel/debug/clk/div_clk1/clk_rate` does not read the hardware.
   It echoes a *software constant* - the `19200000` literal inside
   `DEFINE_CLK_SMD_RPM_XO_BUFFER(div_clk1, 11, 19200000)` - through a
   `recalc_rate` that returns it verbatim. It says nothing about the pin. The
   note above presented it as measured fact and that was wrong.

   The downstream evidence now points the other way. Downstream declares the same
   clock the same way, `DEFINE_CLK_RPM_SMD_XO_BUFFER(div_clk1, div_a_clk1,
   DIV_CLK1_ID)`, wires it to the codec as `osr_clk`
   (`CLK_LOOKUP("osr_clk", div_clk1.c, "msm-dai-q6-dev.16384")`), and **never
   calls `clk_set_rate` on it at all** - just `clk_get` and
   `clk_prepare_enable`, exactly like this port. Its codec is told 9.6MHz through
   `A_CHIP_CTL` exactly like ours. If 19.2MHz really reached the pin, downstream
   would be just as broken. The likeliest reading is that RPM or the board
   configuration already divides that buffer to 9.6MHz and **both kernels simply
   mislabel it**. `clk_set_rate()` succeeding without doing anything is still a
   wart worth knowing about, but it is probably harmless.

   **And the PMIC divider is a dead end on this PMIC.** Landing just the driver
   and an inert `qcom,spmi-clkdiv` node at `0x5b00` under `pm8941_0` - nothing
   consuming it, no pin mux, codec untouched - hung the boot exactly as the
   five-part version had, with no USB at all, neither gadget nor fastboot. That
   bisect is the useful part: the hang is the driver reaching that address over
   SPMI, not anything to do with the codec. **PM8941 has no CLKDIV peripheral
   there**; those arrived on later PMICs like the PM8998 in the binding's own
   example, and on 8974 the PMIC clock buffers are managed by RPM instead, which
   is exactly why mainline models them as RPM clocks. Do not retry this. Reverted
   in full; `boot-images/boot-r90.img` restored over fastboot both times.

   **A confound removed: it is not a second, unconsumed port.** Every earlier
   overflow reading was `status_rx0 = 0x03`, both ports 0 and 1, because
   `SLIM RX2 MUX` had been left subscribed by an earlier test while only RX1's
   mixer was ever routed - so port 1 legitimately had no consumer. Clearing every
   `SLIM RX<n> MUX` to `ZERO` first and subscribing only RX1 gives the clean
   case: one channel (`0x180 = 0x01`), one port enabled, mixer on `RX1`
   (`CONN_RX1_B1_CTL = 0x05`), chain powered (`1ab = 0xa0`, `30f = 0x01`) - and
   `status_rx0 = 0x01`. **A single correctly-mapped, correctly-routed port still
   never drains.** Clear the muxes first in any future test; the default state is
   not empty.

   **`CDC_CONN` is missing compared to downstream, and it is not the answer.**
   Downstream has a supply widget this port lacks entirely -
   `SND_SOC_DAPM_SUPPLY("CDC_CONN", WCD9XXX_A_CDC_CLK_OTHR_CTL, 2, 0, ...)` - and
   that register reads `0x00` here, never written. It looked promising because
   the RX mixer inputs are exactly the `CDC_CONN_RX*` registers. Sweeping every
   bit of `A_CDC_CLK_OTHR_CTL` live during playback, up to `0xff` with all bits
   set, changes nothing. Downstream only routes `CDC_CONN` to capture-side
   widgets (the DEC muxes, MAD, I2S) anyway, never to the RX path.

   **The wcd9335 lifecycle does not transplant.** wcd9335 is the only sibling
   that works on mainline's SLIMbus stream API, and it runs **both**
   `slim_stream_prepare()` and `slim_stream_enable()` from `wcd9335_trigger()` on
   `TRIGGER_START`, with teardown on `TRIGGER_STOP`; `hw_params` only computes
   the config, writes the interface device's channel map and watermark, and calls
   `slim_stream_allocate()`. This port called `slim_stream_prepare()` from
   `hw_params` - and that call is not passive, it walks the port mask running
   `slim_connect_port_channel()` - so the port was attached to the channel long
   before the codec chain existed. That is a real divergence and it was worth
   trying. Matching the split exactly, verified live by kretprobe
   (`sprep: (wcd9320_trigger+0x74 <- slim_stream_prepare) ret=0`), **does not fix
   the overflow** and **regresses the close handshake**: the timeout returns on
   every playback, eight in one boot. The reason is that our
   `wcd9320_codec_enable_slim_chmask(dai, false)` wait lives in
   `SND_SOC_DAPM_POST_PMD`, which now runs *after* `trigger(STOP)` has already
   closed the ports, so the wait never sees them close. wcd9335 has no such wait
   at all. Reverted; timeouts back to zero.

   **Also verified equal to wcd9335, so do not re-check:** the interface register
   arithmetic (`RX_PORT_CFG(16+p) = 0x30+16+p = 0x40+p`,
   `RX_PORT_MULTI_CHNL_0(16+p) = 0x140+4*(16+p) = 0x180+4p`), the watermark
   constant (`(12BYTES << 1) | ENABLE` = `0x05`), the port table
   (`{.port = p + 16, .shift = p}`), and `port_mask` (`BIT(ch->port)`, bits 16+).

   **The overflow bit was finally validated, and it means what we assumed.**
   Everything above rests on reading OVERFLOW as "data is arriving and nothing is
   consuming it", and that had never been checked against a negative control.
   With no stream anywhere, disable both ports, clear the status, then enable
   port 0 alone with the same `WATER_MARK_VAL`:

        ports disabled, status=0x00
        port enabled, no stream, t=1s: status=0x00 src0=0x00  clean
                                 t=2s: status=0x00 src0=0x00  clean
                                 t=3s: status=0x00 src0=0x00  clean

   An enabled port with nothing feeding it does **not** report overflow. So the
   bit is not a side effect of enabling a port, and during playback the ADSP
   really is delivering into the port while the codec really is consuming
   nothing. The instrument is sound and the conclusion stands.

   (Note the starting state in that run: `status=0x03` with no stream running at
   all, left latched from the previous playback. Latched status survives the
   stream, so always clear before measuring.)

   **A golden reference is reachable with zero writes, and here is the recipe.**
   The phone already has TWRP installed on `FOTAKernel` (mmcblk0p16) - boot it
   with the volume-down combo, *not* `fastboot boot`, which this Sony bootloader
   does not honour (it hangs at the Sony logo). TWRP runs the **downstream 3.4.0
   vendor kernel**, the one whose WCD9320 driver works. adb comes up as
   `recovery`. Nothing below writes to the device; the mounts are read-only or
   volatile and vanish on reboot:

        mount -o ro /dev/block/mmcblk0p23 /s      # system: LineageOS 18.1
        mkdir -p /firmware/image
        mount --bind /s/system/etc/firmware /firmware/image
        setsid sh -c "exec 3<>/dev/subsys_adsp; sleep 600" &   # boots the ADSP
        mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug

   The ADSP really does boot this way - `pil-q6v5-lpass ... adsp: Brought out of
   reset` - and then SLIMbus enumerates **both** `taiko-slim-ifd` and
   `taiko-slim-pgd` and `taiko_codec` binds. So the whole downstream stack can be
   stood up in recovery, on this phone, without touching pmOS.

   **What it cannot do, so far: play.** `snd_soc_register_card()` returns
   -EPROBE_DEFER. The very first attempt at boot got further - all the DAI
   mappings succeeded and it then failed with `failed to init SLIMBUS_0_RX: -19`
   0.4s after the ADSP came out of reset, which looks like it simply raced the
   AFE service. After that failure `taiko_codec_remove()` tore the component
   down, and every rebind since defers because the q6 DAI components are gone.
   Unbinding and rebinding `taiko_codec` and the card in various orders does not
   recover it. So there is still no dump of the registers *during* a working
   playback, which is the one that would settle this.

   **And the register window is narrower than hoped.** Downstream's debugfs is
   `/sys/kernel/debug/wcd9310_slimbus_interface_device/{peek,poke}` - write an
   address to `peek`, read the value back - but `codec_debug_write()` routes both
   through `wcd9xxx_interface_reg_read/write`, so it reaches the **interface
   device only**, registers <= 0x3FF. There is no PGD/codec equivalent.

   **The dump we did get says the interface device matches.** Downstream, codec
   bound, no playback, every non-zero interface register:

        001: 0x21   002: 0x01   020: 0x4d   021: 0x47
        030: 0xff   031: 0xff   032: 0xff

   Identical to ours - same `0x21/0x01/0x4d/0x47`, same all-ones interrupt
   enables. The interface device is configured the same way on both sides.

   **The card failure is now pinned down exactly, and it is a race in APR.**
   Turning on ASoC's dynamic debug (`echo "file sound/soc/soc-core.c +p" >
   /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control`) before the probe makes it name what
   it is waiting for, instead of deferring silently. The real sequence is:

        [35.691] apr_tal:Q6 Is Up
        [36.004] apr_register: adsp not up
        [36.004] afe_set_config: Q6 interface prepare failed -19
        [36.004] msm_afe_set_config: Failed to set codec registers config -19
        [36.005] msm_audrx_init: Failed to set AFE config -19

   The card's deferred probe retries the instant the ADSP's q6 DAIs register,
   about 300ms after `apr_tal` announces Q6, and APR's own subsystem-state
   notifier has not marked the ADSP loaded yet, so `apr_register` refuses.
   **-19 is not -EPROBE_DEFER, so there is no second automatic attempt.** Win
   that race and the card should come up; everything before it already succeeds,
   including every DAI mapping.

   **Three traps, all learned the hard way:**

   - **Hold the ADSP open from the host**, not the device:
     `adb shell 'exec 3<>/dev/subsys_adsp; while :; do sleep 5; done'` as a
     background job on the laptop. TWRP kills device-side background processes
     when adb disconnects, and dropping that fd runs `subsystem_put()`, which
     shuts the ADSP down and takes all the q6 DAI devices with it.
   - **Do not unbind/rebind `taiko_codec`.** It perturbs the ASoC component list,
     and afterwards the card can no longer resolve `msm-dai-q6-dev.241` - the
     DAI that `qcom,msm-dai-q6-be-afe-pcm-rx.189` registers - even though all 26
     q6 DAI devices are still bound. That state does not recover; only a reboot
     clears it.
   - **Neither `fastboot boot` nor `adb reboot recovery` works** on this
     bootloader. Recovery is only reachable with the key combo, so every attempt
     costs a manual step.

   **That experiment was run on a clean boot, and it fails. The TWRP route is
   closed for a *playing* reference.** Fresh boot, ADSP held from the host, the
   retry failing with -19 exactly as predicted, then binding the card by hand
   without going anywhere near `taiko_codec`:

        msm8974-asoc-taiko fe02b000.sound: CPU DAI msm-dai-q6-dev.241 not registered

   So the earlier guess was wrong: it is **not** caused by rebinding the codec.
   The -19 failure's own cleanup tears down the AFE-PCM RX ASoC DAI, and once
   that is gone no later bind can resolve it. Re-registering just that one device
   does not work either - `unbind`/`bind` on
   `qcom,msm-dai-q6-be-afe-pcm-rx.189` through `msm-dai-q6-dev` both return
   failure, even with the driver path read straight out of sysfs.

   That makes the race structurally unwinnable from userspace. The card gets
   exactly one automatic probe, it fires the instant the q6 DAIs register, and
   APR is not ready for another ~300ms; the failure then destroys the DAI that a
   retry would need. Fixing it means delaying the probe or making `afe_set_config`
   retry - a kernel change, and TWRP's kernel is a prebuilt blob. Everything up
   to that point still works and the recipe above is still the cheapest way to
   stand up the downstream stack for *non-playing* inspection.

   **Operational trap, learned the hard way:** after TWRP has run downstream's
   ADSP firmware, the **next pmOS boot fails SLIMbus enumeration** -

        QMI TXN wait fail: -110
        slim resource not idle: -110
        wcd9320-slim 217:a0:0:0: Failed to get logical address
        wcd9320-slim 217:a0:1:0: Failed to get logical address

   - and no card appears even though the module loads. The ADSP is left in a
   state pmOS's remoteproc cannot re-initialise. **One more reboot clears it**
   and everything comes back normally. Do not go debugging that; just reboot
   again.

   **Failing that**, the expensive route is a real LineageOS boot, which formats
   userdata and so destroys pmOS; **take a fresh backup first**, because the one
   in `backups/` is from 2026-09-09 and predates all of this.

   **A golden reference now exists**, in `docs/golden-reference/`, captured from
   LineageOS 18.1 on this phone with audio actually playing. Read that directory's
   README before doing anything else here - it is the only picture we have of
   this codec working, and it cost the pmOS install to get. The headline results:
   downstream's SLIMbus ports **never overflow** and its interface device is
   byte-identical idle and playing; its per-port status byte reads **0x20** where
   ours reads **0x42**; and every *digital* register we set already matches, so
   the fault is not a codec register value.

   **Restoring pmOS afterwards is documented in `backups/RESTORE.md`** and is
   worth reading before you need it: TWRP's toybox breaks silently past 2 GiB in
   both `dd` and `cat`, `adb push` is the only workable write path and it skips
   the final sector, and a not-quite-perfect inner GPT leaves pmOS stuck in the
   initramfs with `failed to mount subpartitions` and only telnet on port 23 to
   get in with.

   **Two of those three leads are now dead, measured on the phone.**

   *The SLIMbus transactions all succeed.* Tracing `slim_do_transfer` across a
   whole playback: 49x `mc=104` (value-element messaging), 24x `mc=96`, 2x
   `mc=17` - that is **CONNECT_SINK, once per port** - and 2x `mc=20`
   (DISCONNECT_PORT) on teardown. **Every single one returns 0.** So the
   discarded return value in `slim_stream_prepare()` is a real wart in mainline,
   but it is not hiding a failure here.

   *The absence of DEFINE/ACTIVATE_CHANNEL is expected, not a bug.* There is no
   `mc=0x50`/`0x54` in the trace because `slim_stream_enable()` short-circuits:

        if (ctrl->enable_stream) { ret = ctrl->enable_stream(stream); ... return ret; }

   and the NGD controller sets `ctrl->enable_stream =
   qcom_slim_ngd_enable_stream`, which packs the whole thing into one
   `SLIM_USR_MC_DEF_ACT_CHAN` message to the ADSP instead. The rate maths inside
   it is right: `rootfreq = 24576000>>3 = 3072000`, `superfreq = 3072000/768 =
   **4000**`, so `ratem = 48000/4000 = 12`, giving coef 3 and exp 2 - CRM
   `3*2^2 = 12`. Correct.

   *And the ADSP is told exactly the right thing.* kprobe on
   `q6afe_slim_port_prepare`:

        rate=48000 bw=16 fmt=0 nch=2 ch0=144 ch1=145

   Two channels, 144 and 145, 48kHz, 16-bit - precisely what the codec
   subscribes. That also closes the `SLIM_0_RX Channels = Two` lead: mainline has
   no such control because it derives the count from the codec's
   `get_channel_map`, and ours returns the right thing.

   **What remains is the per-port status byte.** Ours during playback against the
   golden reference, same stream, same routing:

        reg        ours   downstream
        030 INT_EN0  fc      ff        (ours masked by our own overflow handler)
        034 status   03      00
        060/061 src  01      00        OVERFLOW vs nothing
        040/041 cfg  05      05        identical
        080/081      42      20        <-- the unexplained difference

   `0x80+p` is defined in wcd9335's header as `SLIM_PGD_PORT_INT_STATUS(p)` but
   **never read anywhere in that driver**, so its bit meanings are not documented
   by any code we have. Ours has bits 1 and 6; downstream has only bit 5.

   **Correction to the golden reference:** the interface-device dumps in
   `docs/golden-reference/` only cover registers `0x00-0xBF`. `0x180`/`0x184`,
   the RX port channel map, were **never captured**, so the claim that they match
   cannot be made either way. Ours reads `03` at both. Re-capturing would mean
   wiping the install again, so treat that range as unknown.

   **The per-port status byte is not the clue it looked like.** Probed directly:
   `0x80`/`0x81` are **read-only** - writing the golden `0x20` does not stick -
   and they are **dynamic on our side**, reading `0x42` while a stream runs and
   **zero** at idle. Downstream's read a static `0x20` in *both* states. So the
   two are not the same quantity and the `0x42` vs `0x20` comparison does not
   mean what the earlier note implied. Bouncing the port enable while the chain
   runs does not move it either. Without documentation for those bits - wcd9335
   defines the register and never reads it - there is nothing further to get
   from it.

   **The MCLK pin function is a dead end too.** `pin 14 (gpio15)` shows
   `(MUX UNCLAIMED)` with the GPIO claimed by our driver, so it is driven as an
   ordinary output. That looked suspicious, but **downstream does exactly the
   same** - `gpio_request(pdata->mclk_gpio, "TAIKO_CODEC_PMIC_MCLK")` in
   `msm8974.c` - and downstream works. Plain-GPIO-high is correct; `func1` is not
   the answer. (The pinctrl `pinmux-select` route also refuses with EINVAL while
   the pin is held as a GPIO, so it cannot be tested that way regardless.)

   **A tooling trap worth knowing:** writing to sysfs/debugfs from Python
   reports failure at **close**, not at `write()`, because the write is buffered.
   A `try/except` around the write catches nothing and the script reports
   success. Three "no change" results were produced this way before it was
   spotted. Use `os.write()` on a raw fd, or check the exception at close.

   **So what is left** is whatever tells the codec's port logic to start pulling
   from an enabled, correctly-configured, correctly-fed slave port. Every layer
   around it has now been measured and is correct: the bus transactions, the DSP
   port config, the channel map, the rate maths, every codec register on the
   path, and the analog supplies. The remaining candidates all sit inside the
   WCD9320 itself and none of them is visible from software we have - which is
   the honest state of this investigation. Every
   *static* register on the path now matches downstream; the gap is more likely a
   missing step in the enable *sequence* or its ordering. The next thing to try
   is capturing what downstream actually writes, in order, during a working
   playback - `taiko-downstream.c` and `taiko-clsh.c` are in the scratchpad, and
   `wcd9xxx-slimslave.c` is in `downstream/`.

   **Use the downstream tree for it.** The driver itself cites
   `LineageOS/android_kernel_sony_msm8974`; `drivers/mfd/wcd9xxx-irq.c` there is
   the reference for the interrupt controller and `wcd9xxx-slimslave.c` for the
   port setup - which has already been checked and matches.

   **An earlier wrong turn, kept because it is the same trap:** `wcd9335` calls
   `slim_get_logical_addr(wcd->slim_ifc_dev)` in its `device_status` callback and
   ignores the result; `wcd9320` never calls it at all, and it *does* have a
   `device_status` callback in the same shape. Adding the call there makes things
   **worse**: both devices then fail to get an address and no card appears at all,
   reproducibly, across a module reload. That attempt is reverted and not kept as
   a patch - the useful part is this paragraph. Whatever the core needs before it
   can hand out an address for `217:a0:0:0`, an extra request at that point is not
   it.

   **So the next question is why the SLIMbus core cannot assign a logical address
   to the interface device**, when it manages one for the PGD on the same bus.
   That is the single thing between here and audible sound.

   **The routing has to be set by hand** in any case; nothing sets it up
   automatically, and without it MultiMedia1 reports "no backend DAIs enabled":

        amixer -c 0 cset name='SLIMBUS_0_RX Audio Mixer MultiMedia1' 1
        amixer -c 0 cset name='SLIM RX1 MUX' AIF1_PB
        amixer -c 0 cset name='RX1 MIX1 INP1' RX1
        amixer -c 0 cset name='RX1 INTERP' 'RX1 MIX2'
        amixer -c 0 cset name='CLASS_H_DSM MUX' DSM_HPHL_RX1
        amixer -c 0 cset name='HPHL DAC Switch' 1
        amixer -c 0 cset name='HPHL Volume' 70%

   **Loose ends.** The controller logs `Error Interrupt received 0x82000000`
   during stream setup. `SLIM RX3`..`RX7 MUX` warn "has no paths", which is
   expected while only RX1/RX2 are routed. Capture is absent entirely - the
   driver registers one playback DAI - so "Not able to allocate memory for 0
   slimbus tx ports" is not a fault.

   **Boot gets slow if the codec is blacklisted**, because the card's dai-links
   then wait on a device that never arrives; one boot took about seven minutes and
   another had to be power-cycled. With the codec loading normally that goes away.
   If it ever has to be blacklisted again, drop the `sound` node with it.

   **The MCLK pin is muxed wrong, and this is measured, not inferred.** The
   codec's master clock reaches the Taiko on **PM8941 GPIO 15**, and downstream's
   own device tree - read straight out of the LineageOS `boot.img` with
   `tools/romdtb.py` - configures that pin as a *special function*, not as a
   GPIO:

        /soc/sound
          qcom,cdc-mclk-gpios     = <phandle 15 0>
          qcom,taiko-mclk-clk-freq = 0x927c00      (9,600,000)

        /soc/.../qcom,pm8941@0/gpios/gpio@ce00     (pin 15)
          qcom,mode      = 1   digital output
          qcom,src-sel   = 2   QPNP_PIN_SEL_FUNC_1
          qcom,vin-sel   = 2
          qcom,pull      = 5   no pull
          qcom,master-en = 1

   Mainline encodes that field identically - `pinctrl-spmi-gpio`'s function
   index 2 is `"func1"` - and on this phone the register reads:

        MODE_CTL (0xce40) = 0x21   ->  value 1, function 0 ("normal"), dir in/out
        DIG_VIN_CTL      = 0x00   (downstream: 2)
        DIG_PULL_CTL     = 0x04   pull down   (downstream: 5, none)

   Function 0 means the pin emits the GPIO's DC level. Every other ordinary GPIO
   on this PMIC is `src-sel = 0`; the MCLK pin is one of the few downstream sets
   to `func1`. So the codec has been fed a static high where it needs 9.6MHz.

   **This is consistent with the entire investigation.** Register access rides
   the SLIMbus clock and needs no MCLK, which is exactly why every register on
   the path compares equal to downstream while the RX port never drains: the
   codec's digital clock tree has no source, so nothing pulls from an enabled,
   correctly-fed slave port.

   **The earlier dismissal of this lead was wrong, and the reason is worth
   keeping.** It rested on downstream also calling
   `gpio_request(pdata->mclk_gpio, "TAIKO_CODEC_PMIC_MCLK")` in `msm8974.c`. It
   does - but `gpio_request()` only *claims* the pin; the mux comes from the DT
   pin config, which is a different mechanism and was never checked. "Downstream
   does the same thing" is only an argument if you have compared the same layer.

   **The rate question is now closed too.** Downstream does `clk_get(cpu_dai->dev,
   "osr_clk")` then `clk_prepare_enable()` and **never calls `clk_set_rate`** -
   identical to this port. So the `div_clk1` rate mislabel (19.2MHz in the
   mainline clock table) is not a difference between the two stacks, and the
   PMIC-divider route stays closed. The clock is also genuinely enabled on our
   side: `/sys/kernel/debug/clk/div_clk1/clk_enable_count` is `0` at idle and
   **`1` during playback**, so `clk_prepare_enable()` works. Only the pin is wrong.

   **Poking the mux live is not enough on its own.** Writing `MODE_CTL = 0x15`
   (dir out, func1, value 1) plus `VIN = 2` and `PULL = 5` mid-session makes the
   pin's readback follow `div_clk1`'s enable state instead of the GPIO level -
   1 while idle, 0 once the clock is enabled, where the "normal" control reads a
   constant 1 - so the mux does reach the pin. **The overflow is unchanged.**
   That is not a refutation: the codec had already come out of reset and run its
   whole register init with no clock. The test that matters - first init with the
   mux already correct - has **not** been run yet, because unloading the codec
   oopsed (see `0065`).

   Note the readback cannot prove a 9.6MHz square wave either way: the PMIC
   samples its input through a much slower synchroniser, so a constant 0 is what
   a clock and a dead pin both look like. Treat the pin state as "changed", not
   as "clocking".

   **`0065` fixes a remove path that oopsed every module unload.**
   `wcd9320_remove()` called `clk_put(wcd->codec_clk)` on a clock it does not
   own - `wcd9320_parse_dt()` takes it with `devm_clk_get()` on the **slim**
   device and probe only copies the pointer - so it dropped a reference this
   device never took and devm put it again on the way out. The trace is
   `__clk_put` <- `wcd9320_remove` <- `platform_remove`. It also called
   `devm_kfree()` on the devm-allocated private data *before*
   `snd_soc_unregister_component()`, leaving the component's callbacks running
   against freed memory. Both are gone; unregister is all that is needed. Until
   this is installed, **do not `modprobe -r snd_soc_wcd9320`** - the oops leaves
   the thread in `D` state holding `module_mutex`, which hangs every later
   `lsmod` and `modprobe`.

   **A single PMIC register can be read after all, and this supersedes the
   "0-01 is unusable" note.** The warning elsewhere in this file is about reading
   the *whole* file; `regmap` debugfs supports seeking, and the dump is a fixed
   9 bytes per line (`"ce40: 21\n"`), so a window can be read directly:

        # register R is at byte offset R*9; pick a bs that divides it
        dd if=/sys/kernel/debug/regmap/0-00/registers bs=144 skip=3300 count=1
        ->  ce40: 21 ... ce4f: 00     (0xce40 = 52800, 52800*9 = 3300*144)

   `bs` must be at least one line long or `read()` returns 0 and `dd` prints
   nothing - `bs=1` silently yields an empty result, which reads like a failed
   permission rather than a too-small buffer. `0-00` is pm8941 SID 0, range
   `0-ffff`, every register readable, and it takes writes as well
   (`echo "ce40 15" > .../registers`) with the debug patch in place.

   **Three reboot traps, all hit in one session.** `/proc/sys/kernel/sysrq` is
   **16** here - sync only - so `echo b > /proc/sysrq-trigger` does nothing at all
   and prints no error; set it to `1` first, in the *same* shell, because the
   value is back to 16 on the next login. `sudo systemd-run --no-block` hangs
   once `systemd-journald` has been killed, so it is not a reliable way to
   outlive the ssh session when the system is already degraded. And plain
   `sync(1)` can block for minutes on a wedged filesystem, which silently eats
   the `timeout` budget of whatever was meant to run after it - put the sysrq
   writes first, not last.


   **RETRACTION: the MCLK pin mux is a real defect but it is NOT the cause.**
   The test the section above says was never run has now been run, on r114, and
   it is negative. With `MODE_CTL/VIN/PULL` held at downstream's exact values
   (`15 02 05`) by a 50ms writer loop across the codec's *first* init of the
   boot, `div_clk1` enabled, and liveness asserted on every reading:

        run 1..5: INT_STATUS_RX_0=03  pcm=RUNNING  procs=1  pin=15 02 05

   Unchanged. Fix the mux anyway - it genuinely disagrees with downstream - but
   it is not what stops the data.

   **And the clock is not the variable at all.** The pin test alone could not
   separate "MCLK is fine" from "func1 is not the clock", so the codec's own
   **RC oscillator** was used as the control: it is internal, needs no pin, and
   is unquestionably present. Switched mid-playback with the full bring-up -
   `BIAS_OSC_BG_CTL=0x17`, `RC_OSC_FREQ` bit7, the `RC_OSC_TEST` pulse,
   `CLK_BUFF_EN1` bit3 set and bit2 cleared (`0x05 -> 0x09`), **including the
   `CLK_BUFF_EN2` reset pulse** that the first attempt wrongly left out - the
   overflow reads `0x03` on every probe, identical to MCLK. The RCO also runs at
   a different frequency, so a clocked-but-wrong-rate core would have shown
   *under*flow. It showed nothing of the sort. The codec's digital core is not
   sitting unclocked, and the whole MCLK line of reasoning is closed.

   **A full two-space register diff against the golden reference now exists**,
   and it is the strongest version of the "registers are not the problem"
   claim. All 666 PGD registers, ours playing against
   `codec_reg-HPH-PLAYING.txt`: **67 differ**, and every one of them is MBHC
   (`3c0`-`3dc`, `14a`-`14f`, `171`-`174`), mic bias (`129`-`13d`), the TX ADCs
   (`153`-`169`), IIR/ANC/PA-ramp (`340`-`364`, `28d`), analog gains
   (`1aa`-`1d9`), interrupt masks (`090`-`0af`, ours masked by our own overflow
   handler) or read-only fuses. Downstream runs subsystems this port does not;
   **not one register on the RX data path differs.**

   The interface device is the same story. Ours playing against
   `ifd-HPH-PLAYING.txt`, `0x00-0xBF`: only `030` (our masking), `034` and
   `060/061` (the overflow itself) and `080/081` differ. **`040 = 05` and
   `041 = 05`, matching downstream exactly** - an earlier spot-check that read
   `041`/`042` and reported "port 2 not enabled" was reading the wrong pair,
   since our ports are 0 and 1.

   **Two more candidates killed by live poke.** `LDO_H_MODE_1` is the one
   non-MBHC analog difference - ours `0x6d`, downstream `0xed`, identical but
   for bit 7 - and writing `0xed` mid-playback (confirmed by readback) changes
   nothing. And the **supplies are right**: our DT maps them exactly as
   downstream does (`vdd-buck`->s2, `vdd-rx-h`/`vdd-tx-h`/`vddpx-1`->s3,
   `vdd-a-1p2v`/`vddcx-1`/`vddcx-2`->l1), and on the phone `s2=2150000`,
   `s3=1800000`, `l1=1225000` are all enabled with users, which are downstream's
   own voltages to the microvolt.

   **`0066` makes the codec reloadable, which changes how this is worked on.**
   With `0065` the module unloads cleanly, but the *reload* then oopsed at
   `wcd9320_probe+0x68`: the codec's platform device is created by
   `of_platform_populate()` from the slim status callback and nothing
   depopulates it, so it outlives the unload, and on the next load the platform
   driver is matched against that leftover device before the slim device has
   probed and set its drvdata - `control` is NULL and probe writes through it.
   `0066` returns `-EPROBE_DEFER` in that case. Together the two mean a codec
   change can now be tested with `unbind card; modprobe -r; modprobe; bind card`
   instead of a reboot per iteration.

   **Where that leaves it.** Data demonstrably arrives at the right ports, the
   codec consumes none of it, and every layer that can be read has now been
   compared against a working reference and matches: both register spaces, the
   clock (by substitution, not by inspection), the supplies and their voltages,
   the bus transactions, the DSP port config and the rate maths. The one layer
   never compared against downstream is **what the SLIMbus manager is told, and
   what the codec is told, about the channel**. `slim_stream_enable()`
   short-circuits into `qcom_slim_ngd_enable_stream()`, which packs everything
   into one `SLIM_USR_MC_DEF_ACT_CHAN` QMI message to the ADSP rather than
   emitting DEFINE_CHANNEL/ACTIVATE_CHANNEL on the bus. That was written off as
   "expected, not a bug", and it is expected - but nobody has checked that the
   resulting channel definition matches what `CONNECT_SINK` bound on the codec
   side. Downstream's `slim-msm-ngd.c` sends its own version of the same QMI
   message; diffing the two payloads is the same kind of source-level comparison
   that turned up the pin mux, and it is the next thing to do.

   **Correction to the recovery instructions elsewhere in this file:** powering
   this phone off is **Power + Volume Up**, not a ten-second power hold, which
   does nothing.


   **A SLIMbus capture path now exists (`0067`, `0068`), and the bisection it was
   built for is inconclusive.** The idea was to test the CDC-to-port interface
   in the other direction: the overflow already proves the port engine's
   *receive* half works, since bus data really does land in the port FIFO, so
   what is broken is specifically the transfer from that FIFO into the CDC. If
   the codec could fill a TX port, the interface works and the fault is
   RX-specific.

   `0067` adds the codec half: the `tx_chs` table (the card was already passing
   `tx_ch[] = {128, 129, ...}` to `set_channel_map` and it was being dropped
   because `tx_chs` was NULL), a capture DAI, a `SLIM TX1 MUX` to subscribe a
   channel, an `enable_slimtx` widget handler, and `wcd_slim_tx_stream_prepare()`
   as a **separate function** rather than a direction flag on the RX one - the RX
   path is the only thing that works as far as the bus and it was not worth
   risking to save the duplication. `0068` adds the two dai-links the card needs
   (`MultiMedia2` frontend, `SLIMBUS_0_TX` backend on codec DAI index 1); without
   them `arecord` listed no capture devices at all. That one needs a **boot image
   flash**, since it is device tree - it went in cleanly and the phone booted in
   90 seconds.

   **It works as far as it goes:** `card 0, device 2: MultiMedia2` appears, the
   stream runs, and our TX port registers are written correctly - `cfg 0x50 =
   0x05`, `chmap 0x100 = 0x01`.

   **But both instruments failed their controls, so nothing can be concluded.**

   - *TX port status is not an instrument.* `INT_STATUS_TX_0` reads `0x00` in
     every condition, including with the decimator's clock switched **off**
     mid-capture, which starves the port and should underflow. The TX interrupts
     are genuinely enabled (`INT_TX_EN0` is `0x30 + 2` = `0x32`, reading `0xff`),
     so this is not a masking artefact - the bit simply never asserts. Note the
     RX side reports overflow and port-closed reliably, so this asymmetry is
     itself unexplained.
   - *The captured audio is not an instrument either.* With the TX slave port
     **disabled** (`cfg 0x50 = 0x04`), `arecord` still produced a byte-identical
     384044-byte file of zeros. The ADSP manufactures a well-formed 48kHz stream
     whether or not the codec contributes anything.

   **What it would take to finish.** Real, non-zero audio from the codec, which
   means an analog mic path: micbias, the ADC enable, and the decimator input
   mux. The golden reference cannot shortcut this - downstream was playing to
   headphones when it was captured and had **no TX path active** (`0x30a = 0x00`,
   TX clock off), so there are no known-good TX values to copy. That is
   implementing capture properly rather than running an experiment, and it is the
   same work the microphone needs, so it is not wasted - but it should be chosen
   as a feature, not as a probe.

   **A bug worth not repeating, introduced and fixed here.** The first version of
   `slim_tx_mux_put()` called `list_add_tail()` without checking whether the node
   was already linked. Setting the control twice spliced the channel list into a
   **cycle**, and `wcd9320_get_channel_map()` then walked it forever, writing past
   the end of the caller's 16-entry `tx_slot[]` array - a stack smash inside
   `msm_snd_hw_params()`, whose trace came back with the return address
   overwritten by `0x80`, which is `BASE_CH_NUM`, the value being written. The RX
   mux guards this with `wcd_slim_rx_vport_validation()`. The fix makes the
   subscribe idempotent. **Any list_add on these shared channel nodes needs that
   guard.**

   **Operational note: do not unbind and rebind the card to reload the codec.**
   `0065` and `0066` make `modprobe -r` and `modprobe` work, but
   `echo sound > .../bind` afterwards oopsed in `regmap_write` inside the
   component probe. That path has never once completed successfully. Test codec
   changes on a **fresh boot** instead - and note that every oops here is followed
   by a reboot that wedges with sshd never starting, which costs a physical
   power-cycle (**Power + Volume Up**).


## Vibrator

`0040`, one line. Mainline already has the driver (`pm8xxx-vibrator.c`), the config
already had `CONFIG_INPUT_PM8XXX_VIBRATOR=y`, and `pm8941.dtsi` already carries
`pm8941_vib: vibrator@c000` with the right compatible - it is just left
`status = "disabled"`, and no msm8974 board in the tree enables it. Both stock and
LineageOS run this exact node (`qcom,vib@c000`, `qcom,qpnp-vibrator`, okay), so the
hardware is there.

**SOLVED 2026-09-15: the motor runs and was felt.** On r84 `pm8xxx_vib_ffmemless`
is `event0`, the driver is bound at `fc4cf000.spmi:pm8941@1:vibrator@c000`, the node
advertises `FF_RUMBLE`, and an `EVIOCSFF` upload followed by an `EV_FF` play produces
a burst you can feel. That last step is the whole point: an ff-memless device
enumerates whether or not a motor is wired to that PMIC output, so enumeration on r83
proved nothing and only playing it could.

**That test is now written: `tools/ff-test.py`.** It needs no compiler on the phone -
it packs the struct and the ioctl numbers itself - and it scans `/dev/input`, reports
which node advertises `FF_RUMBLE`, then uploads and plays three bursts at different
magnitudes. Its scan half is already exercised against r56, where it correctly finds
`gpio-keys`, `pm8941_pwrkey` and the Synaptics touchscreen and no FF device at all;
what is untested is the upload, which needs the vibrator present.

`sizeof(struct ff_effect)` is **44** on arm32, not 40 - `custom_len` in
`ff_periodic_effect` is a `__u32`, which makes the union 28 bytes on top of a 16-byte
header (14 bytes of shorts, padded to 16 for the union's alignment). `EVIOCSFF`
encodes that size in the ioctl number, so getting it wrong does not fail cleanly: it
returns `EFAULT`, which reads like a driver bug rather than an arithmetic one. The
correct number is `0x402c4580`, and the script asserts its own packing.

`pm8xxx-vibrator` accepts **`FF_RUMBLE` only** and takes its level from
`strong_magnitude >> 8`, so `0xffff` is full scale and anything below `0x0100` rounds
to a stop.

Enabled on amami only rather than rhine-wide, since honami and togari cannot be
tested here.

## Camera: bigger than audio

Surveyed, not started. Mainline's CAMSS driver matches `qcom,msm8916-camss`,
`msm8953`, `msm8996`, `sc7280`, `sc8280xp` and `sdm660` - **there is no msm8974
support**, so it would need a new resource table and version alongside those.

Worse, the sensors are not described in any standard way. Stock binds
`qcom,camera@20` and `@6c` as `qcom,sony_camera_0` / `_1`, Sony's own binding, with
the actual parts identified only by module codes and per-module power sequences -
`SOI08BS2` and `SOI20BS0` at the rear, `LGI02BN1` and `SEM02BN1` at the front. So
even after CAMSS, each module needs identifying and a sensor driver wiring up.

That makes camera the largest single area left, ahead of audio.

## Parked patches

Out of the build, kept because the data in them was expensive to recover:

- `0034`, `0035`, `0036`, `0037` - the GPU and MDP IOMMUs, and the page-size fix.
- `0018`, `0025` - the earlier `qcom_iommu` node and the GPU's binding to it.
- `0027` - the non-secure BFB settings.
- `0031` - subscribing to every data type. Now known not to be a proximity fix:
  proximity *is* the primary type. It would be the route to an ambient light
  channel, which does work at the SMGR level.
- `0046` - answering unmapped registry groups with zeroes instead of failing.
  Tried on hardware, changed nothing.
- `debug/9004` - dumps the whole SMMU state after a successful attach.

In the build but inert without those: `0017` (optional secure id), `0019` (the `alt`
clock, which is what stopped the first attempt hanging the phone), `0026` (detaching
the ARM DMA mapping).

Check `glxinfo -B` reports `FD330` after touching any of this, not merely that the
screen lights up: a broken IOMMU shows up as a silent fallback to `llvmpipe`.

## Smaller loose ends

- The CPU wedge is fixed but only partly explained: the two observed failures had
  different signatures, so there may be a second bug behind the first.
- `reboot bootloader` is a dead end - S1Boot ignores the Qualcomm magics at `0x65c`.
  Getting to fastboot still means holding Volume Up while plugging in.
- ~~`BAT_THERM` sits at 642 mV...~~ **Resolved, and the extended band is correct
  rather than a workaround.** Calibrated from the VADC's own references
  (97.37 uV/count) against `VDD_VADC` = 1781.7 mV, the thermistor reads **606.5 mV at
  rest, 34.0% of the reference**. The narrow jeita floor is 35% = 623.6 mV, so this
  battery reads *below* it at ordinary room temperature - the narrow band inhibits
  charging permanently, not marginally. The extended floor is 25% = 445.4 mV.
  Ten minutes of four-core load moved it to 562.7 mV for a +7.1 C rise in PMIC die
  temperature, about **-6.2 mV/C**, and the battery kept cooling more slowly than the
  SoC afterwards, so it warmed less than 7 C and the true per-battery-degree slope is
  steeper still. Either way there is roughly 26 C or more of headroom before the
  extended hot threshold trips, which puts it near 50 C - about where a charger should
  stop anyway. Nothing to fix.

  The underlying reason is that the PM8941 BTC thresholds are fixed percentages of the
  thermistor reference, sized for Qualcomm's reference battery, and amami's sits
  lower. Worth knowing: **mainline has no `SCALE_BATT_THERM`.** Downstream declares
  this channel with `qcom,scale-function = <1>` (a dedicated battery-thermistor
  table); mainline only offers `DEFAULT`, `THERM_100K_PULLUP`, `PMIC_THERM`,
  `XOTHERM` and the HW_CALIB variants. That is why `LR_MUX1_BAT_THERM` has no
  `_input` attribute and why `qcom_smbb` reports no battery `temp` at all.
  Follow-up worth one boot: declare the channel with `SCALE_THERM_100K_PULLUP` and
  check the reported temperature against a cold and a warm reference. If the battery's
  NTC is a 100k part the existing table may be close enough to give a real `temp`.
- **The battery thermistor now reports a temperature (`0069`).** It was declared
  `VADC_CHAN_NO_SCALE(LR_MUX1_BAT_THERM, 0)`, so it appeared as
  `in_voltage48_raw` with no `_input` and nothing could read a battery
  temperature. Mainline has no `SCALE_BATT_THERM`; of the tables it does carry,
  `SCALE_THERM_100K_PULLUP` is the closest, and on this phone it lands sensibly:

        in_temp48_label   LR_MUX1_BAT_THERM
        in_temp48_input   39120      (39.1 C)
        DIE_TEMP          45735      (45.7 C, same moment)

  624mV on the channel, which the 100k table puts at 39C, against a PMIC die at
  45.7C - a battery a few degrees under the die is what you would expect. The
  scale function is chosen **in the driver**, not from DT (`prop.scale_fn_type =
  vadc_chans[prop.channel].scale_fn_type`), so this is a driver patch and needs
  no reflash. RAW is still exposed, so the millivolts remain available.

  **Treat it as indicative, not calibrated** - it is the generic 100k curve, not
  this battery's own table. But it does genuinely *track*, which was checked
  rather than assumed (2026-09-19, five minutes of four-core load then cooldown,
  sampled every 30s):

        base   39.29 -> 39.34 C   die 45.69 -> 45.49    flat
        LOAD   39.34 -> 40.96 C   die 45.49 -> 51.14    monotonic, every sample
        cool   40.96 -> 41.14 C   die 51.14 -> 49.15    still RISING
               41.14 -> 40.78 C   die       -> 47.73    then decaying slowly

  Three things there are hard to fake. The baseline is flat to 0.05C, so the
  channel is not drifting or noisy. The load ramp is monotonic on every single
  sample, +1.62C of battery against +5.65C of die - about 29%, which is the right
  order for a cell against an SoC die rather than the 1:1 you would see if this
  were secretly reading the die. And on cooldown the **battery keeps rising for
  60-90s after the load stops**, peaking at 41.14C while the die has already
  dropped 2C, then decays slowly. That lag is the signature of a large thermal
  mass, and neither a stuck reading nor a mislabelled channel produces it.

  What is still unverified is the *absolute* calibration - a cold reference would
  need the phone put somewhere cold, which nobody has done.

  Note this does **not** give `qcom_smbb` a `temp` property: that driver only
  reads the PMIC's BTC comparator for health and has no
  `POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_TEMP`. `/sys/class/power_supply/smbb-bif` still has no
  `temp`. Wiring one up means a driver change plus an `io-channels` entry in DT,
  and the DT half would need a flash.

- **The charger now reports that temperature too (`0070`, `0071`).**
  `qcom_smbb` gained `POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_TEMP`, reading a `batt-therm` IIO
  channel looked up lazily on first use exactly as `vbat` is, and the DT hands
  it `VADC_LR_MUX1_BAT_THERM`. Verified end to end on r119:

        iio in_temp48_input          35714 m C
        smbb-bif/temp                  357        (tenths, so 35.7 C)
        upower temperature            35.7 degrees C

  Two unit traps in that path, both live in `smbb_battery_temp()`: IIO processed
  temperature is milli-degrees while `POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_TEMP` is **tenths**,
  hence the `/100`; and `iio_read_channel_processed()` returns `IIO_VAL_INT` on
  success rather than 0, so only a negative is an error - the same quirk that
  bit the fuel gauge.

  `CONFIG_CHARGER_QCOM_SMBB=y`, so the driver half needs a flash as much as the
  DT half does; one flash covered both.

  **This is the change the USB trap warns about, and it was safe only because
  the mitigation was already there.** Adding `io-channels` to `&smbb` is what
  once killed USB through fw_devlink. The new channel comes from the *same*
  provider as the existing `vbat` one, and `post-init-providers =
  <&pm8941_vadc>` was already on the node, so the edge stays cleared. Confirmed
  in the built DTB rather than the patch text - `charger@1000` shows
  `io-channels = 0xa5:0x06, 0xa5:0x30` with one provider - and confirmed again
  after the flash by `/sys/class/udc/ci_hdrc.0` still existing. **Anything that
  adds a phandle from `&smbb` to a different provider still needs its own
  `post-init-providers` entry.**

- **WiFi power save retested 2026-09-19, and it still cannot be enabled.** The
  31 mA WCNSS costs makes this worth one attempt, and the answer is unchanged
  from 2026-09-09 - `0008` did not help:

        309.37  wlan0: associated                   <- association succeeds
        320.37  Timeout! No SMD response to req 78  <- hal_enter_bmps, FIRST failure
        320.38  Can not enter BMPS!
        340.86+ every later request times out       <- firmware wedged for good

  `hal_enter_bmps` is the first thing to fail, and after it the firmware answers
  nothing: `hal_set_link_st`, `hal_switch_channel`, `hal_enter_imps`,
  `hal_delete_sta_self` and `hal_stop` each burn their full 10s timeout. Only a
  reboot recovers WiFi. The 31 mA stays.

  **Two traps if anyone retries.** NetworkManager stores power save *per
  connection*, in `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/<name>.nmconnection`
  as `powersave=3`, and that overrides the global `conf.d` file - so one attempt
  wedges WiFi on **every subsequent boot** until the profile is edited back.
  And `nmcli` cannot undo it once things are wedged, because NM dies with the
  device; the revert is a `sed` on the file plus a reboot.

  The thing to investigate, if it is ever worth another wedge-and-reboot cycle,
  is why the firmware never answers `ENTER_BMPS`.
  `wcn36xx_smd_enter_bmps()` sends `msg_body.tbtt = vif->bss_conf.sync_tsf` and
  `msg_body.dtim_period = vif_priv->dtim_period`; a zero or stale value in
  either is the usual cause.

- **Trap: unloading `qcom_spmi_vadc` powers the phone off.** It is `=m`, so a
  reload looks like the cheap way to test a VADC change. It is not. The module is
  the capacity source behind `/sys/class/power_supply/smbb-bif`, and while it is
  gone UPower sees 0% with `warning-level: action` and performs its critical
  action, which is now PowerOff - the old `CriticalPowerAction=Ignore` workaround
  was removed once the fuel gauge became real (see
  [[xperia-z1c-power-shutdown]]). The phone shut down cleanly about two minutes
  after a `modprobe -r qcom_spmi_vadc`, on a battery reading 4.30V, and had to be
  powered back on by hand. **Reboot to pick up a VADC change, or stop upower
  first.**

- `THERMAL_EMULATION` is still enabled. It is how the thermal trips were tested, and
  it also lets root feed the thermal core a fake low reading. Worth dropping once the
  frequency ceiling can reach 75 C honestly.
